The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. They want me to only emit entities that match previously extracted types and add them in the same format.\n\nFirst, I need to check the previous contexts provided. Looking at the contexts, there are entries related to \"Migration Assessment,\" \"Extraction Status,\" \"SAP Document AI,\" and some software versions. The user is probably referring to an extraction process where certain entities like software names, features, dates, and statuses were extracted before.\n\nThe user's current question is about adding missed entities. But the problem is, the current query doesn't provide new data or context beyond what's already in the previous contexts. The previous contexts already list entities like \"Migration Assessment,\" \"Cloud Foundry,\" \"Extraction Status,\" \"SAP Document AI,\" and specific dates and versions. \n\nSince the user is asking to add entities that match previously extracted types, I need to check if there's any new information in the current query. However, the current question doesn't include any new data points. The user might be referring to the existing contexts but wants to ensure all entities from those contexts are included. However, the initial instruction says to only emit entities that match previously extracted types, which are already present in the contexts provided. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to the fact that in the previous extraction, some entities were missed. But without new data to extract from, I can't add new entities. The existing contexts have already been processed. Unless there's an implicit request to re-express the existing entities again, but the user's instruction says to add them below using the same format. However, the user hasn't provided any new data to extract from. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is that there are no new entities to add because the current query doesn't provide additional information. The user might need to provide more data or clarify the context for new entities to be extracted.\n</think>\n\nThe current query does not provide new data or context to extract additional entities. Previously extracted entities (e.g., \"Migration Assessment,\" \"Extraction Status,\" \"SAP Document AI,\" \"Cloud Foundry,\" software versions, dates) are already documented in the provided contexts.
