The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, looking at the text, there are two records. The first one is about Joule capabilities in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2023 FPS01. The second is about new use cases in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. \n\nStarting with the first record. The key points are \"Joule allows you to release, accept...\" and \"Fetch Solution Quotation Information\". Since the entity types don't include technology as an allowed type, I need to represent these as events. The valid as of date is 2025-09-23, so the event name would be something like \"JOULE CAPABILITIES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-09-23\". The description should mention the new features.\n\nNext, the second record mentions Joule enabling viewing of business data in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, specifically Condition Records for Pricing in Sales. Again, this is a new capability, so another event entity. The valid as of date here is also 2025-09-23, so the event name would be \"JOULE USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-09-23\". The description should note the business objects available.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. The text mentions SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and Public Edition. However, according to the rules, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. Since SAP is an organization, but the editions might be considered products, which are not allowed unless under the event type. So maybe SAP is the organization here. Wait, the user's examples included \"Microsoft Azure\" as an organization. In the given text, \"SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\" and \"Public Edition\" are products, so they shouldn't be emitted as entities. However, \"SAP\" itself is an organization. But the text doesn't explicitly mention \"SAP\" as the organization, just the product names. Hmm, maybe there's no organization entity here. \n\nLooking for GEOs. The text doesn't mention any real-world locations, so no GEO entities. \n\nFor relationships, the events are related to SAP S/4HANA Cloud editions. But since those are products and not allowed as entities, maybe there's no relationship. Wait, the user's example D had relationships between the event and the organization (Microsoft Azure) and the GEO. In this case, the events are about Joule's capabilities in SAP's cloud editions. But since SAP is the organization, but the product names are not allowed, perhaps the event is linked to SAP as the organization. However, the text doesn't explicitly state that SAP is the organization here. The product names are part of SAP's offerings, but the rules say to emit organizations only if explicitly mentioned. Since the text doesn't mention \"SAP\" as the organization, maybe there's no organization entity here. \n\nWait, the user's example C had \"SAP SUCCESSFACTORS\" as part of the event name but didn't emit it as an entity. So maybe in this case, the events are standalone without relationships. \n\nSo, the output would be two event entities with their descriptions, and no relationships since there are no qualifying organizations or GEOs mentioned. \n\nLet me check the rules again. The user said if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit events. Since the entity types include event, and the text is about new capabilities (events), that's correct. Also, products like SAP S/4HANA Cloud editions are not emitted as entities. \n\nSo the final output should have two event entities and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE CAPABILITIES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>Joule enables release/acceptance of solution quotations and fetching quotation data in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2023 FPS01+)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports viewing condition records for pricing in sales within SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923770, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 970, "prompt_tokens": 2937, "total_tokens": 3907, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 38.82795612841246, "duration": 24.982}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
