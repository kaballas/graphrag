It allows administrators to assign specific roles and permissions to users, including tasks related to alumni and onboarding processes. RBP enables field-level permissions, granting employees the ability to manage their account data securely and efficiently. Recent enhancements to RBP include the ability for administrators to set target criteria for viewing attributes in the Growth Portfolio, further refining access control. Additionally, RBP ensures that data imports in Employee Central are validated for users within the defined target population, maintaining data integrity and compliance.
