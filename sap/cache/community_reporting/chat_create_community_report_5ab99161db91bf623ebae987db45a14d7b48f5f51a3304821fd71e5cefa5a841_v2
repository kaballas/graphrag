The user wants a comprehensive report based on the provided sources. First, I need to parse the given data and identify the key entities and their relationships. The sources are about SAP BTP Cockpit updates, specifically in the Cloud Management Tools component. \n\nLooking at the records, there are three main entries: 3387, 3388, and 3389. Each describes changes to the SAP BTP Cockpit's Entitlements pages and a new Costs and Usage page. The entities here are the SAP BTP Cockpit, the Entitlements pages, the Costs and Usage page, and the various features like Entitlement Source, Licensed Quantity, etc. \n\nThe title should reflect the key entities. Maybe \"SAP BTP Cockpit Entitlements and Cost Transparency Enhancements (2024-02-22)\" since the date is mentioned in all records. \n\nFor the summary, I need to highlight the main changes: the new commercial info in Entitlements, the replacement of Usage Analytics with Costs and Usage, and usability improvements. The importance rating would be high because these updates affect how users manage their accounts and track costs, which is crucial for businesses using SAP BTP.\n\nThe detailed findings should break down each enhancement. For example, the first finding could be about the commercial information in Entitlements, referencing record 3387. The second about the Costs and Usage page from 3388, and the third about usability improvements from 3389. Each explanation needs to detail the changes and their implications, citing the relevant records. \n\nI need to ensure that the date range is correct. All records have the same valid date of 2024-02-22, so the date range would be [2024-02-22, 2024-02-22]. \n\nAlso, check the grounding rules. Each point should reference the data sources properly. Since there are three records, each finding will reference the corresponding record. Make sure not to list more than five record IDs, but here there are only three, so that's straightforward. \n\nFinally, structure the JSON as per the example, ensuring all sections are included and formatted correctly without any markdown. Avoid any extra escape sequences and keep the JSON valid.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"SAP BTP Cockpit Entitlements and Cost Transparency Enhancements (2024-02-22)\",\n    \"summary\": \"This report outlines key updates to SAP BTP Cockpit's Entitlements and Cost Management features, focusing on commercial transparency, usability improvements, and billing traceability.

With this enhancement, we've added entitlement source information, which displays how each entitled plan was added to your global account. This addition allows global account admins and viewers to gain a better understanding of the relationship between contractual service entitlements and the technical assets (services and plans) in your global account. This functionality is highly valuable, for example, if your account has multiple subscriptions from different packages for the same service plan, or your global account is entitled to service plans that are derived from both the subscription-based and consumption-based models.  Here's what you can expect:      Entitlements  Service Assignments page: Look for the Show commercial info toggle button. By turning on this option, you will see these new commercially-oriented columns added to the main table: Entitlement Source, Licensed Quantity, and Commercial Type.      Entitlements  Entity Assignments page:    Find the new View Commercial Info tab, which provides comprehensive commercial information.      Add Service Plans toggle button. By turning on this dialog box: Each service plan now includes an expandable Entitlements Sources section. This feature is accessible when configuring your assignments in the Manage Assignments view.          Additionally, we've introduced an Entitlement Source filter in both pages, allowing you to easily list plans based on their source of entitlement.   Note that this commercial information is not available for trial accounts.

The new page offers a new look and exciting capabilities focusing on enhancing the cost transparency of the service consumption in your global account. All the features in the old Usage Analytics page are still available in the new page but may work a little differently now.  These are the new capabilities you can expect:      Billing Verification: Verify billing accurately using data and terminology incorporated from your monthly balance statement.      Cross Charging Analysis: Easily track and manage costs in your account hierarchy through search and filter options based on labels.      Advanced Usage and Cost Monitoring: Compare usage and costs for multiple services, see trends, and drill into subaccounts for more details.      Direct Access to Filtered Views: Bookmark your filters and search queries for quicker direct access and easier sharing with colleagues.      Note that if your global account has only a subscription-based commercial agreement, then the new page is called Usage.
