The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various records from SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform) related to different components like Cloud Foundry, Kyma, ABAP Environment, etc. The goal is to structure this information into a report with specific sections: title, summary, importance rating, rating explanation, detailed findings, and date range.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the data to identify key entities and their relationships. The main entities here are the different SAP BTP components and regions. For example, Cloud Foundry, Kyma, ABAP Environment, and regions like Brazil (São Paulo), Australia (Sydney), etc. The relationships are the updates, deprecations, and new features associated with these components and regions.\n\nLooking at the records, there are several updates about new regions being added, such as Brazil and Australia in Cloud Foundry and Kyma environments. There are also changes in security protocols, like the deprecation of weak client certificates and TLS 1.2 CBC ciphers. Additionally, there are improvements in services like the API Gateway module and Identity Provisioning.\n\nNext, I need to determine the importance rating. Since these updates are critical for maintaining security, expanding regional availability, and improving functionalities, the importance rating should be high. Maybe around 8.5, as they affect multiple areas and require user action.\n\nFor the detailed findings, I should list key insights. For example, the expansion of regions, security updates, enhancements in API Gateway, Identity Provisioning improvements, and the deprecation of certain technologies. Each finding needs a summary and explanation, citing relevant records.\n\nThe date range should cover the earliest and latest dates mentioned in the records. The earliest is 2023-11-02, and the latest is 2024-12-18.\n\nI need to ensure that each finding references the appropriate records using the data: notation. Also, check that the JSON structure is correct, with proper commas and brackets. Avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"SAP BTP Regional Expansion and Security Updates (2023-2024)\",\n    \"summary\": \"This report examines SAP BTP's 2023-2024 updates focusing on regional expansion, security hardening, and service enhancements.

If you only provide the leftmost label in the spec.hosts field of an APIRule custom resource (CR), it uses the domain name from the referenced Gateway, expanding the host to <label>.<gateway domain>. See Sample Custom Resources.      We've fixed the wildcard path format and the validation of the rule path in an APIRule.      Release 2.7 of the API Gateway module includes the fully functional version of APIRule v2alpha1 with noAuth, jwt, and extAuth access strategies. Version v2alpha1 is not meant for use in a production environment but for testing purposes only. After the rollout to the regular channel on October 28, 2024, you’ll be required to start testing the migration procedure. To learn more, see the APIRule migration blog post. It provides the timeline for deletion of APIRule v1beta1 and covers the following migration scenarios:  From the noop, allow, or no_authhandler in version v1beta1 to the noAuth handler in version v2alpha1  From the jwt handler in version v1beta1 to the new configuration of the jwt handler in version v2alpha1    The migration procedure from OAuth2 handlers based on Ory Oathkeeper to the new extAuth handler will be published in the next blog post.

We will do so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openssl.org%2Fdocs%2Fman3.0%2Fman3%2FSSL_CTX_set_security_level.html%23DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  The change will be rolled out gradually, starting with the region br10 on November 29 and the region eu20 on November 30, 2023. All other regions are planned to be updated in January 2024. Further details regarding the timelines for the remaining regions will be announced through this channel in a timely manner.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates / mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  If you are using client certificates / mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command:openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see SAP Note 3333978 .

Actually, the position was shifted by one. Note  The runtime was not affected.This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  Passwords with leading or trailing spaces did not work neither in the logon screen nor in the LDAP test UI. When creating a backup in the administration UI with a password containing special characters, it could not be restored. This was a regression introduced with version 2.15.1.The issue has been fixed.Note  Creating backups with the REST API was not affected.    Selecting a subaccount in the administration UI might have failed. This happened if there are more than 100 subaccounts hosted on the Cloud Connector instance and when filtering the subaccount list. In this case, a completely different one was selected when choosing the subaccount. This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  During an upgrade via RPM it could happen that the UI after the initial login screen was not loading. In the traces of the Cloud Connector, you could see many messages telling that a JAR file could not be found that was existing only before the upgrade. This could be resolved by a restart of the daemon only. The issue was caused by another issue in upgrade processing, which has been improved to avoid the erroneous situation.  Avoid a NullPointerException when receiving a close request in RFC protocol processing. This could lead to wrong values for the connection monitor for RFC connections. The call stack of the exception started with java.lang.NullPointerException: while trying to invoke the method com.sap.core.connectivity.spi.processing.TargetHost.connectionProtocol() of a null object loaded from local variable 'target' at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.updateNonRequestBased(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:109) at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.reportCloseConnection(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:96)  Corrupted subaccounts could not be loaded properly. As a consequence, it was impossible to delete them from the administration UI. In some cases, they even did not appear in the list of subaccounts, but were existing, so trying to add such a subaccount would fail.This issue has been fixed.      Self-signed system certificates containing SANs need to have all CA attributes, which is not desired for the system certificate, and hence it does not have them.
