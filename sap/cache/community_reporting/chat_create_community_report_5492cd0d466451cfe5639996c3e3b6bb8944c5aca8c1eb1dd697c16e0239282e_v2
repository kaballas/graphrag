On the SAP Analytics Cloud product page, you’ll find a complete set of SAP Analytics Cloud guides and resources.  Some highlights include:   Stories improvements:  In the optimized story experience, the filter by member dialog has been redesigned and now provides new features:  Improved UI architecture: The UI layout of the member selector provides direct access to the essential actions and settings, such as the search field and the hierarchy selection. Other settings, like read mode or text presentation, have been moved into a settings panel that can be opened on demand. The multi-column presentation of the selectable members allows for better readability.  Increased flexibility: The dialog box can now be resized, and can be dragged to a different position. The panels are also resizable, and the content of the panels are fully responsive.   Continuous scrolling: The new member selector implements a lazy loading mechanism that applies to the list of selectable members as well as the list of member selections: as you scroll down, members are automatically and continuously loaded at the bottom.  Search hits highlighting: The new member selector bolds each part of a member label that matches the search criteria.  Enhanced search capabilities: The new member selector supports the wildcard search, specifically the wildcard character “*” which replaces zero or more characters.  Enhanced member exclusion paradigm: The new member selector introduces an advanced paradigm for member exclusion: it allows you to deselect one or more descendants of a selected node. For example, select the country “USA” but explicitly exclude the state “Florida”. This selection is dynamic, which means that if, in the data source, a new state is registered under the country “USA”, it is implicitly part of the selection.
