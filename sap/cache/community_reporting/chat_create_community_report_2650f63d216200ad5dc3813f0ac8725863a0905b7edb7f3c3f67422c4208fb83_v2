As of then, the consistency check will also check whether users assigned to tasks, folders, or on header level have been deleted. If the check detects any deleted users, messages are raised and may cause the consistency check to fail due to errors. The following logic will be applied:  If a deleted user is assigned as the user responsible, processing user, or remote processing user, the consistency check fails. No task list generation is possible.  If a deleted user is assigned as an interested user, the consistency check is successful, but it shows warnings. Task list generation is possible.  If a user group consists only of deleted users and is assigned as the responsible user group or processing user group, the consistency check fails. No task list generation is possible.  If a user group consists only of deleted users and is assigned as an interested user group, the consistency check is successful, but it shows warnings. Task list generation is possible.
