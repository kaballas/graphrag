The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various SAP components and their updates, deprecations, and new features across different environments like Cloud Foundry, ABAP, Kyma, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the sources, the main components are SAP Build Process Automation, Continuous Integration & Delivery, SAP Translation Hub, Kyma Runtime, SAP Document AI, and others. These components are part of SAP's technology stack, so the community is likely around SAP's Cloud Foundry and related services.\n\nNext, the summary should highlight how these entities are interconnected. For example, deprecations in build tools affect multiple components, and new features in one area (like AI) integrate with others. The importance rating would be high because these updates impact SAP's ecosystem significantly, affecting development, compliance, and user experience.\n\nFor detailed findings, I'll list key points like the deprecation of older build tools (Java 8 Node 18, Node 18), new features in process automation, AI integrations, and regional expansions. Each finding needs to reference the relevant records. I have to ensure that the date range covers all the mentioned updates, from 2023 to 2025. Also, I need to follow the grounding rules, citing the record IDs properly without exceeding five per reference.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with proper sections and no markdown.

SAML trust configurations are deprecated for user-interactive authentication in customer-owned accounts regardless of the specific identity provider. The CIO Guide: Identity Lifecycle in SAP Landscapes provides the guidance for this deprecation. We recommend a single trust configuration per subaccount with SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. This configuration enables direct usage of SAP Cloud Identity Services by applications and services, meaning without the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service. Such direct usage of SAP Cloud Identity Services is the recommended programming model for new applications and services.  The deprecation doesn't apply to the following cases:      Principal propagation using the SAML Bearer flow. An example for this is an SAML trust configuration to accept API calls on behalf of users from another subaccount using a destination.      Trust between a partner-owned subaccount and a customer-owned tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services. OIDC support for this constellation is planned, but isn't possible yet. Until then, use SAML and make sure the trusted identity provider is already SAP Cloud Identity Services and not any other identity provider.      Trust between your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant and your corporate identity provider.      Note  This announcement has no bearing on the use of SAML for other SAP products or other use cases within the SAP BTP family of solutions.   Existing SAML trust configurations affected by the deprecation will still be tolerated after the deprecation date and continue to work. Support will be restricted to security-related fixes.   Impact  When you create a new trust configuration for interactive login, choose a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services with the OIDC protocol. Use Establish Trust in the SAP BTP cockpit or the btp create security/trust command of the btp CLI. For more information, see the documentation about Establish Trust.

It will stay available for a short time after that, and then will be removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. When this version disappears, deployment and redeployment of Cloud Foundry applications running on Node.js 18 will fail.   Action: We strongly recommend that you migrate your applications to Node.js 20 or 22 as soon as possible.   In exceptional cases (if you haven’t managed to switch to Node.js 20 in time), to avoid application failures during redeployment, you can pin the last buildpack version that contains Node.js 18, as provided by the nodejs-buildpack community. To learn how, see: Specify a buildpack version  If you are using MTA deployment descriptors, in your mtad.yaml file you need to define module type javascript.nodejs and set parameter buildpack to nodejs_buildpack. For example:    modules:- name: myapp  type: javascript.nodejs  parameters:    memory: 512M    buildpack: nodejs_buildpack    If you want to pin a particular buildpack version (for example, 1.8.34), you can do it the following way:    modules:- name: myapp  type: javascript.nodejs  parameters:    memory: 512M    buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack.git#v1.8.34    To learn more, see MTA Module Types.   NOTE: SAP does not recommend use of Node.js 18 after its end-of-life date as no support and security fixes will be provided for this version anymore.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-03-12\nValid as Of: 2025-04-30\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record \",472\n\n\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}, "key": "chat_create_community_report_7cd1c71b6656d5abe37ceed1268c4ff347e8acfb5231110c6f9cfa3444ba23c5_v2"}
