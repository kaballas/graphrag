For more information, see Transparent Proxy in the Kyma Environment.      Transparent Proxy supports the Destination Fragment feature, allowing for the extension of a destination with a fragment. The destination fragments themselves enable more flexible technical connection configuration management for the solution administrators. Now, using the Transparent Proxy, you can easily consume target systems defined as destination-fragment pairs.   For more information, see Extending Destinations with Fragments and Destination Fragments.      Transparent Proxy now supports a new integration with Connectivity Proxy in the so-called multi-region setup.
