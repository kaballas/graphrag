The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided entities and their relationships. The data given is from SAP-related updates and changes across different components and environments. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the sources and identify the key entities. Looking at the records, the main components are SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry, ABAP Environment, Connectivity, Region, etc. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry, Kyma, Neo, and specific regions like Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore, etc. \n\nNext, I should determine the relationships between these entities. For example, new regions being added (like Frankfurt in Cloud Foundry) and changes in IP addresses affecting connectivity. Also, updates to services like the Cloud Connector and changes in authentication methods.\n\nThe summary needs to capture the overall structure, how entities are related, and significant insights. The importance rating should reflect the criticality of these updates, especially those affecting security and compliance. \n\nFor the detailed findings, I'll list key insights such as the expansion of regions, security enhancements (like TLS changes and certificate deprecation), UI improvements in SAP Business Application Studio, and the impact of IP address changes on firewall configurations. Each finding should be supported by the relevant data records.\n\nI need to ensure that the date range covers all the mentioned updates, from the earliest (2023) to the latest (2025).

For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openssl.org%2Fdocs%2Fman3.0%2Fman3%2FSSL_CTX_set_security_level.html%23DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  The change will be rolled out gradually, starting with the region br10 on November 29 and the region eu20 on November 30, 2023.

Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates / mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  If you are using client certificates / mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command:openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see SAP Note 3333978 .

This is a reminder that the range will start to be used from October 8, 2025.   Actions:      If your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules, please adapt your configuration before October 8, 2025 by allowlisting the specified NAT IP address range.   Remove the following IP ranges from allowlisting between October 20, 2025 and October 24, 2025 if your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules. This is necessary because these IP ranges will be released from SAP and returned to AWS for redistribution, which changes their availability. Removing these ranges helps prevent unauthorized access to your environments by other AWS clients.

Action:  Older clients might be affected by this change. To maintain connectivity, please check and ensure that your clients are supporting one of the following TLS 1.2 ciphers that are still supported:     TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      After the deletion of the deprecated ciphers, requests from older HTTP client libraries that do not include any of the supported ciphers will fail during the TLS handshake. To verify that your client can connect without CBC ciphers, you can connect it to the following test application. If the client can establish a connection to the endpoint, the server returns the message ok along with a status code 200.

Actually, the position was shifted by one. Note  The runtime was not affected.This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  Passwords with leading or trailing spaces did not work neither in the logon screen nor in the LDAP test UI. When creating a backup in the administration UI with a password containing special characters, it could not be restored. This was a regression introduced with version 2.15.1.The issue has been fixed.Note  Creating backups with the REST API was not affected.    Selecting a subaccount in the administration UI might have failed. This happened if there are more than 100 subaccounts hosted on the Cloud Connector instance and when filtering the subaccount list. In this case, a completely different one was selected when choosing the subaccount. This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  During an upgrade via RPM it could happen that the UI after the initial login screen was not loading. In the traces of the Cloud Connector, you could see many messages telling that a JAR file could not be found that was existing only before the upgrade. This could be resolved by a restart of the daemon only. The issue was caused by another issue in upgrade processing, which has been improved to avoid the erroneous situation.  Avoid a NullPointerException when receiving a close request in RFC protocol processing. This could lead to wrong values for the connection monitor for RFC connections. The call stack of the exception started with java.lang.NullPointerException: while trying to invoke the method com.sap.core.connectivity.spi.processing.TargetHost.connectionProtocol() of a null object loaded from local variable 'target' at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.updateNonRequestBased(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:109) at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.reportCloseConnection(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:96)  Corrupted subaccounts could not be loaded properly. As a consequence, it was impossible to delete them from the administration UI. In some cases, they even did not appear in the list of subaccounts, but were existing, so trying to add such a subaccount would fail.This issue has been fixed.      Self-signed system certificates containing SANs need to have all CA attributes, which is not desired for the system certificate, and hence it does not have them.
