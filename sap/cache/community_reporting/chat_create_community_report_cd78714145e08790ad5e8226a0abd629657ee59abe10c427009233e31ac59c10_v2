This default will be changed to x509 (instead of binding-secret).   Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type\"\", \"\"x509\"\"]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.   For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.  Until 2025-04-30 you may configure the credential-type to binding-secret, to restore the previous configuration.\nAction: Recommended\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-22\nValid as Of: 2025-01-22\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1578 ---\nComponent: Pricing Service\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Pre-Production -Support X.509 Certificates\nDescription: For getting an oauth token to call an endpoint of the Pricing service it used to be required to specify the client id and the client secret.

Action: If the UI of the consuming application allows it, it is recommended to always read the configuration results during interactive configuration without the possible values of characteristics. This can be achieved by using the parameter $select omitting the parameter value possibleValue when creating or reading a configuration. Only when the user clicks on a UI element, like a dropdown list box, that requires to render the possible values on the UI, the possible values should be read for that characteristic using the new endpoint.
