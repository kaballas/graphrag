The actual communication protocol may be any TCP-based protocol, for example, ODBC/JDBC, SMTP, etc. For more information, see Multitenancy.  Simple arbitrary access to destinations. Dynamically access the target systems via a single destination custom resource, instead of creating such for every locally exposed destination.For more information, see Dynamic Lookup of Destinations.  Native integration with Istio. Easily, via single configuration, add the target systems or service endpoints exposed via Transparent Proxy to the Istio service mesh.For more information, see Configuration Guide.   Native integration with the Connectivity Proxy in multi-tenant trusted mode. You can now easily consume target systems without sending identity tokens to the Connectivity Proxy.  Automated update of service keys, in use by Transparent Proxy, upon Kubernetes secrets change.   The Transparent Proxy module in Kyma now auto-detects and loads all Destination service instance bindings within its namespace, reducing the need for manual configuration. For more information, see Transparent Proxy in the Kyma Environment.

The change is planned to be done in October 2024.  Currently, the service update is fail-safe, and even in the event of a failure, MTA deployment will proceed successfully. This behavior, however, is problematic as it conceals issues that may arise during MTA deployment, which are only detected at a later stage or even during runtime.  The behavior will be changed and MTA deployments will start to fail in case of service instance update failure.  Action:If a certain service instance should not impact the whole MTA deployment there are two options to proceed. Choose one depending on your needs:    Declare the MTA resource as optional – when making an MTA resource optional all operations related to it are fail-safe. It includes not only the service instance update but also service binding, unbinding, etc. The option is valuable for service instances that are optional during the runtime of your application;      Avoid service instance updates by providing parameter skip-service-updates – the option could be interpreted as “create-only” for the service instance. It is useful when a service instance needs to be created in the initial MTA deployment and not altered afterwards. The parameter skip-service-updates defines the different parts of the service instance that are to be omitted during update. See the example for skipping service updates.    \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-07-15\nValid as Of: 2024-10-17\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2094 ---\nComponent: SAP Build Process Automation\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Additional Property Required for Using SAP Task Center\nDescription: If you are using SAP Task Center together with SAP Build Process Automation in different subaccounts and if your security protocol is SAML 2.0, you must set an additional property in your Identity_Authentication_Connectivity_IDS destination.
