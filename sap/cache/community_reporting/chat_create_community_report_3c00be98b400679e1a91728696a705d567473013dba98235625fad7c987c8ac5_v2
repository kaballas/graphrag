For example, adding or removing an item or adding or removing a manual condition is not possible.  The existing endpoint GET /pricing/documents/{documentId} will be enhanced to return the locked flag for a document.   The existing endpoint GET /pricing/documents will be enhanced to allow searching for locked documents.
