You are affected by this change if you explicitly use the xsenableasyncservice property in your security descriptor and it is set to false.  If you use the xsenableasyncservice property with the value false, update and creation of service instances fails.  Action  If you're affected, ensure that your application works with asynchronous service instance creation and update before the end-of-life date.  To test, remove xsenableasyncservice from the security descriptor prior to the change. If you use the element with the value true, you can remove it without any impact.  In addition, consider adapting any Cloud Foundry CLI commands in your scripts so that they wait for processing to complete:    cf create-service xsuaa application xsuaa-app -c security.json --wait  cf update-service xsuaa-app -c security.json --wait    Note  Cloud Foundry CLI version 8 and later supports the --wait option.  Ensure that your application or service works with asynchronous service instance creations and updates.
