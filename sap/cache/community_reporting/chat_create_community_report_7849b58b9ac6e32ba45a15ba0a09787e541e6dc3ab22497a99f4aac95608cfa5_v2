The user wants a comprehensive report based on the provided sources. First, I need to parse the data and identify the key entities and their relationships. The sources are about SAP BTP updates, deprecations, and new features across different environments like Cloud Foundry, Neo, and Kubernetes.\n\nLooking at the records, there are several components mentioned: SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime, Service Manager, Java Server, Authorization and Trust Management Service, etc. Each has specific changes or announcements. The main themes are security updates (like deprecating weak certificates), removal of buildpacks, IP address changes, and updates to services.\n\nI need to structure the report with a title that captures the essence. Maybe something like \"SAP BTP Security and Infrastructure Updates in 2023-2024\" since the dates range from 2023 to 2024. The summary should highlight the key areas: security hardening, deprecations, IP changes, and service updates.\n\nFor the importance rating, considering the impact on security and infrastructure, a high rating like 8.5 makes sense. The explanation would note the critical security measures and infrastructure changes affecting multiple regions and services.\n\nDetailed findings should list the main points. Each finding needs a summary and explanation with data references. For example, the deprecation of weak certificates affects all regions, requiring action. The removal of .NET, Ruby, R buildpacks is another key point. IP address updates in AWS regions and the Neo environment are important for network configurations. The Service Manager's secret format change and Java Tomcat updates are also significant.\n\nI need to ensure each finding references the correct records. Also, the date range should cover from the earliest (2023-11-02) to the latest (2024-02-22). Checking the records for consistency in dates and ensuring all relevant points are included without exceeding the word limit.

We will do so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openssl.org%2Fdocs%2Fman3.0%2Fman3%2FSSL_CTX_set_security_level.html%23DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  The change will be rolled out gradually, starting with the region br10 on November 29 and the region eu20 on November 30, 2023. All other regions are planned to be updated in January 2024. Further details regarding the timelines for the remaining regions will be announced through this channel in a timely manner.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates / mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  If you are using client certificates / mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command:openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see SAP Note 3333978 .
