The user wants a comprehensive report based on the provided data. First, I need to parse all the records and identify the key entities and their relationships. The main components mentioned are Cloud Identity Services, Graph, Kyma Runtime, SAP Document AI, Decentralized Identity Verification, and others. \n\nLooking at the records, Cloud Identity Services has several updates and upgrades across different environments. There's also a lot about the Graph component, including new features and documentation improvements. The Kyma Runtime has Istio module updates. SAP Document AI integrates with SAP Mobile Start. Decentralized Identity Verification has automated credential matching and status checks.\n\nI need to structure the report with a title that captures the main entities. Maybe something like \"SAP Cloud Services and Identity Management Updates 2024-2025\". The summary should highlight the key areas: identity services, graph enhancements, Kyma updates, etc. \n\nFor the importance rating, since these are critical updates affecting multiple services and security, a high rating like 9.5 makes sense. The rating explanation would mention the impact on security, integration, and user experience.\n\nDetailed findings should list the main updates. Each finding needs a summary and explanation with data references. For example, Cloud Identity Services upgrades, Graph documentation improvements, Kyma's Istio updates, SAP Document AI integration, and Decentralized Identity Verification features. Each point should cite the relevant records.\n\nDate range is from the earliest valid date (2024-01-01) to the latest (2025-09-04).

In addition to the default Istio containers, the module also restarts native sidecar init containers. However, configuring native sidecars directly from the Istio Custom Resource (CR) is not supported. For more information, see issue #1426.Caution  If your cluster's Istio service mesh includes workloads with initContainer sidecars, the Istio module will restart these workloads for the first time. See Restart of Workloads with Enabled Istio Sidecar Injection, Istio sidecar documentation, and Kubernetes Native Sidecars in Istio.    We've updated the Istio version to 1.26.2. For more information, read the Istio 1.26.2 release announcement and Istio 1.26.0 release announcement.  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.  We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled.

The previously known URLs <hostname>.cfapps.<region>.hana.ondemand.com will be deactivated soon. We have postponed the deactivation from June 30, 2025 to October 31, 2025. A prompt switch is strongly encouraged.  Starting October 1, 2025, SAP Omnichannel Promotion Pricing services accessed via the outdated URLs will experience reduced performance. To avoid this, ensure you switch to the new URLs before that date.  For more information, see Calculation, Data Upload, Administration, Data Access, Coupon Management.  It is also recommended to recreate the service keys. This way, you can see the new URL of the service endpoint in the service key.
