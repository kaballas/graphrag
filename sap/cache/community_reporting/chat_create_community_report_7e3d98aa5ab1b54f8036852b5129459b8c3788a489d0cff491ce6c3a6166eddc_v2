With this enhancement, we've added entitlement source information, which displays how each entitled plan was added to your global account. This addition allows global account admins and viewers to gain a better understanding of the relationship between contractual service entitlements and the technical assets (services and plans) in your global account. This functionality is highly valuable, for example, if your account has multiple subscriptions from different packages for the same service plan, or your global account is entitled to service plans that are derived from both the subscription-based and consumption-based models.  Here's what you can expect:      Entitlements  Service Assignments page: Look for the Show commercial info toggle button. By turning on this option, you will see these new commercially-oriented columns added to the main table: Entitlement Source, Licensed Quantity, and Commercial Type.      Entitlements  Entity Assignments page:    Find the new View Commercial Info tab, which provides comprehensive commercial information.      Add Service Plans toggle button. By turning on this dialog box: Each service plan now includes an expandable Entitlements Sources section. This feature is accessible when configuring your assignments in the Manage Assignments view.          Additionally, we've introduced an Entitlement Source filter in both pages, allowing you to easily list plans based on their source of entitlement.   Note that this commercial information is not available for trial accounts.

The new page offers a new look and exciting capabilities focusing on enhancing the cost transparency of the service consumption in your global account. All the features in the old Usage Analytics page are still available in the new page but may work a little differently now.  These are the new capabilities you can expect:      Billing Verification: Verify billing accurately using data and terminology incorporated from your monthly balance statement.      Cross Charging Analysis: Easily track and manage costs in your account hierarchy through search and filter options based on labels.      Advanced Usage and Cost Monitoring: Compare usage and costs for multiple services, see trends, and drill into subaccounts for more details.      Direct Access to Filtered Views: Bookmark your filters and search queries for quicker direct access and easier sharing with colleagues.      Note that if your global account has only a subscription-based commercial agreement, then the new page is called Usage.
