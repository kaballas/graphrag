Required Action:  If your JVM is configured to prefer IPv6, you need to verify if you have firewall rules in place that limit outgoing traffic from the network.

Currently, only IPv4 is supported, as such in our documentation, we had only the respective addresses. We have now added also the IPv6 addresses that we plan to use. The enablement of the IPv6 addresses will happen no earlier than February 2026. Until then, please ensure any needed action is performed, based on the information below.  The Destination service ingress endpoints are the ones that are called by your HTTP client, accessing its REST API (you would not usually need to take action for this flow, unless you have productive calls to the service from your own network) and the Cloud Connector (only in the cases where automatic token retrieval is performed for an on-premise OAuth destination). If you make use of this on-premise token retrieval functionality and if the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does not support IPv6, no action is needed, as the IPv4 addresses are unaffected.   If the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does support IPv6, then the Java virtual machine will usually prefer to use IPv4 instead of IPv6 (usually controlled via the java.net.preferIPv6Addresses system property). If this is the case for your Java virtual machine, again, no action is needed.   Required Action:  If your JVM is configured to prefer IPv6, you need to verify if you have firewall rules in place that limit outgoing traffic from the network. If that is the case, you would have previously allowed the certain IPv4 addresses to enable the Cloud Connector’s communication with BTP. Now, you need to add also the IPv6 addresses to the allowlist.    Note  As of version 2.18.1, the Cloud Connector shows the IPv6 status on the About screen.    The Destination service egress IPs are the ones on behalf of which external resources are accessed either via Check Connection or automatic token retrieval for an Internet destination. In some cases, you might have an allowlist for IPs at the target system. If that is the case, please add the IPv6 addresses of the Destination service to the list.

This was caused by a changed default value introduced in Tomcat 9.0.90. With the upgrade to Tomcat 9.0.95, the problem has been solved. This was a regression in 2.17.1.  When upgrading a shadow instance, the master high availability (HA) port got lost during the upgrade. This was a regression in 2.17.1.  Pressing CapsLock when entering a password into Cloud Connector's login screen deleted the password characters that were entered so far. This was caused by a regression in UI5 Core 1.108.30 that was used in 2.17.1.  In the connection monitor details view the active requests were not showing the user that is invoking the service, even if the user is actually known. This was a regression introduced in 2.16.0.  Due to a faulty consistency check, the custom regions list contained all the known regions that were in use on the Cloud Connector. This illegal state has been corrected.  When using a dedicated HA port and resetting the HA settings on a shadow, the shadow's UI port within the HA information was wrongly set to the HA port. As a consequence, after connecting again to a master, it was not possible to open the shadow UI using the button in the master UI in the High Availability screen.  \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-10-31\nValid as Of: 2024-10-31\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2006 ---\nComponent: Connectivity\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Neo\nTitle: Cloud Connector 2.17.2 - Enhancements\nDescription: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.17.2 provides the following enhancements:    Introduced a CapsLock warning on all password input fields. Previously, such a warning was only shown on the login screen.  Cloud Connector does no longer allow to upload UI certificates from a P12 file that include the KeyUsage certsigning. Such certificates are not accepted by all browsers for identifying a server.  The connection check for access control entries is now allowed for all authenticated users.

Action:  Older clients might be affected by this change. To maintain connectivity, please check and ensure that your clients are supporting one of the following TLS 1.2 ciphers that are still supported:     TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      After the deletion of the deprecated ciphers, requests from older HTTP client libraries that do not include any of the supported ciphers will fail during the TLS handshake.

Actually, the position was shifted by one. Note  The runtime was not affected.This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  Passwords with leading or trailing spaces did not work neither in the logon screen nor in the LDAP test UI. When creating a backup in the administration UI with a password containing special characters, it could not be restored. This was a regression introduced with version 2.15.1.The issue has been fixed.Note  Creating backups with the REST API was not affected.    Selecting a subaccount in the administration UI might have failed. This happened if there are more than 100 subaccounts hosted on the Cloud Connector instance and when filtering the subaccount list. In this case, a completely different one was selected when choosing the subaccount. This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  During an upgrade via RPM it could happen that the UI after the initial login screen was not loading. In the traces of the Cloud Connector, you could see many messages telling that a JAR file could not be found that was existing only before the upgrade. This could be resolved by a restart of the daemon only. The issue was caused by another issue in upgrade processing, which has been improved to avoid the erroneous situation.  Avoid a NullPointerException when receiving a close request in RFC protocol processing. This could lead to wrong values for the connection monitor for RFC connections. The call stack of the exception started with java.lang.NullPointerException: while trying to invoke the method com.sap.core.connectivity.spi.processing.TargetHost.connectionProtocol() of a null object loaded from local variable 'target' at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.updateNonRequestBased(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:109) at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.reportCloseConnection(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:96)  Corrupted subaccounts could not be loaded properly. As a consequence, it was impossible to delete them from the administration UI. In some cases, they even did not appear in the list of subaccounts, but were existing, so trying to add such a subaccount would fail.This issue has been fixed.      Self-signed system certificates containing SANs need to have all CA attributes, which is not desired for the system certificate, and hence it does not have them.
