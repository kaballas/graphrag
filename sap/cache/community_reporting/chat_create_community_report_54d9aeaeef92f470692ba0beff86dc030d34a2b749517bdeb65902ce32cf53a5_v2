Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates/mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  Action:  If you are using client certificates/mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command: openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see 3333978 .  If your certificate fails the verification, please contact the issuer of the certificate with the command you executed and the output you got and request a certificate that passes the verification.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-25\nValid as Of: 2024-01-25\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3603 ---\nComponent: Cloud Management Tools,SAP BTP Cockpit\nEnvironment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other\nTitle: New Quick Action for Global Account Administrators to Assign Themselves as Subaccount Administrators in the Account Explorer\nDescription: If you're a global account administrator, you can now easily assign yourself as an administrator of any subaccount in your account structure. Go to the Account Explorer page in the SAP BTP cockpit and look for the new Add Me as Admin option in the    (Actions) context menu of the listed subaccounts.
