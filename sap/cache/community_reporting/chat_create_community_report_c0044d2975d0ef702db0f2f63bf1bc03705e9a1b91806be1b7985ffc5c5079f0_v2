The deprecation phase will start on October 28, 2024. APIRule v1beta1 version will be deleted on May 12, 2025. To make sure you can smoothly migrate your APIRule custom resources (CRs) to the stable version v2, you can start testing version v2alpha1 and provide feedback before the migration window opens. Version v2alpha1 is intended for testing purposes only, helping you evaluate the new version’s compatibility and functionality. It is not recommended for use in production environments. By testing APIRule v2alpha1 in advance and providing feedback, you can help us further refine this version, ensuring that the formal upgrade will have minimal impact on your operations. The migration process does not disturb any existing applications.   We expect version v2alpha1 to be promoted to version v2 without significant changes. The release of version v2 is planned for April 15, 2025. After that, you will be required to complete the migration from version v1beta1 to version v2 by May 12, 2025.  Recommended action: We strongly recommend that you test the migration process in a non-production environment using version v2alpha1. This will not only help you familiarize yourself with the new features but also allow us to optimize the migration experience and apply your feedback.  Required action: During the migration window lasting from April 15, 2025 until May 12, 2025, you must migrate your production APIRule CRs to version v2.   For detailed migration steps and timelines, see the blog posts on the APIRule migration for the noAuth and jwt handlers and APIRule migration for the ORY Oathkeeper-based OAuth2 handlers. \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-10-21\nValid as Of: 2024-10-28\nVersion: Cloud\n\n\",198\n196,\" Available in UI Technologies\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-05-07\nValid as Of: 2025-05-15\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 877 ---\nComponent: Feature Flags Service\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Kyma\nTitle: Service Instance Sharing\nDescription: You can now share SAP Feature Flags service instances between different Cloud Foundry organizations in the same subaccount.
