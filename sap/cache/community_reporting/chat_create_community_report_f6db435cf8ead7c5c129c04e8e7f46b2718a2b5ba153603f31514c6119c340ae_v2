We will do so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openssl.org%2Fdocs%2Fman3.0%2Fman3%2FSSL_CTX_set_security_level.html%23DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  The change will be rolled out gradually, starting with the region br10 on November 29 and the region eu20 on November 30, 2023. All other regions are planned to be updated in January 2024. Further details regarding the timelines for the remaining regions will be announced through this channel in a timely manner.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates / mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  If you are using client certificates / mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command:openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see SAP Note 3333978 .  Action:  Please contact the issuer of the certificate with the command you executed and the output you got and request a certificate that passes the verification.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2023-11-02\nValid as Of: 2023-11-02\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3952 ---\nComponent: SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Removal of .NET, Ruby, and R Buildpacks\nDescription: This the final reminder that the .NET, Ruby, and R offline buildpacks have been deprecated and are scheduled to be removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment on November 16, 2023.

It is now planned for November 16, 2023.   The following ciphers are affected:        TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384      Note that TLS 1.3 Cipher Suites are not affected by this change.  Action:  Older clients might be affected by this change.
