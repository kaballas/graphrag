These four apps consist of the following two sets of apps:  Two apps offering a task view:  Financial Close Overview - Task View  Closing Task Completion - Task View    Two apps offering an organizational unit view:  Financial Close Overview - Organizational Unit View  Closing Task Completion - Organizational Unit View      Task view apps offer reporting based on the task overall status, while organizational unit view apps offer reporting based on the task execution status of each organizational unit. Additionally, organizational unit apps allow you to perform reporting based on company code groups, independently of country/region assignments.  Note  For these new apps, new static role templates are available that need to be assigned to users, so they can access the new apps.  Caution  The new reporting apps display data from task lists generated after the release of these apps only. Data from previous closing cycles can be viewed in the predecessor apps Financial Close Overview (Deprecated) and Closing Task Completion (Deprecated).
