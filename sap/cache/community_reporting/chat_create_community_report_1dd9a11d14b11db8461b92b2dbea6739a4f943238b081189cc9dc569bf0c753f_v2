For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openssl.org%2Fdocs%2Fman3.0%2Fman3%2FSSL_CTX_set_security_level.html%23DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  The change will be rolled out gradually, starting with the region br10 on November 29 and the region eu20 on November 30, 2023.

Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates / mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  If you are using client certificates / mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command:openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see SAP Note 3333978 .
