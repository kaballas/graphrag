The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes several records related to SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform) updates, security changes, and service announcements. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the data and identify the key entities and their relationships. The main components here are various SAP services like Authorization and Trust Management Service, Cloud Foundry Runtime, Java Buildpack, HANA Spatial Services, etc. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry, Neo, Kyma, ABAP, and others. The actions required range from recommended updates to mandatory changes, which indicates the importance of these updates.\n\nLooking at the records, there's a lot of information about updates to Tomcat versions, signing key rotations, end-of-life for certain service plans, and certificate replacements. These are all technical changes that affect the SAP ecosystem. The entities involved are the different components and services, and their relationships are through the updates and changes they undergo.\n\nThe title should reflect the key entities. Since the main focus is on SAP BTP updates and security measures, maybe something like \"SAP BTP Security and Runtime Updates for 2025-2026\". The summary needs to highlight the main points: the updates, the end-of-life services, and the security changes. \n\nFor the importance rating, considering the number of required actions and the impact on existing systems, a high rating like 8.5 makes sense. The explanation would mention the critical security updates and mandatory changes affecting service plans and credentials.\n\nIn the detailed findings, I need to list key insights. Each insight should have a summary and explanation. For example, the Tomcat version updates, automatic key rotation, end-of-life for instance secrets, certificate replacement, and the delay in token signing key operations. Each of these points should reference the relevant records.\n\nThe date range should cover from the earliest valid date (2025-01-09) to the latest (2026-04-01). \n\nI need to ensure that each finding is supported by the correct data references, using the record IDs provided. Also, check that the JSON structure is correct, with proper formatting and no escape sequences.

Your service instance was created before 12 November 2024 without the explicit configuration of credential types in your security descriptor.

Creating bindings or service keys with the credential type instance-secret fail.      Existing instance secrets are removed or rejected if they haven't been used for more than 3 months.
