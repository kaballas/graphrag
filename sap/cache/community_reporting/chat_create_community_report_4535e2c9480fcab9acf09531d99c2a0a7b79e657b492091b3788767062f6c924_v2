To be able to use it, the following standard requirement formulas were changed:    Requirement formula 5 is now supported. It ensures that a condition type is only considered if the exclusion indicator was not set by a previously found condition record.      Requirement formula 6 is now supported. It ensures that a condition type is only considered if the exclusion indicator was not set to X by a previously found condition record.      Requirement formula 2 was enhanced to not only check if the pricing indicator (KOMP-PRSFD) equals X or B, but to also check that the exclusion indicator was not set by a previously found condition record.
