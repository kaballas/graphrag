The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various technical updates and changes related to SAP systems, like the BTP Cockpit, Authorization and Trust Management, and Financial Closing apps. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the sources, the main components are SAP BTP Cockpit, SAP Advanced Financial Closing, SAP Document AI, SAP Datasphere, and others. These are the core systems involved. The relationships are about updates, changes, and new features in these systems.\n\nNext, the title should be specific. Maybe something like \"SAP System Updates and Enhancements in 2024-2025\" to cover the time frame and the main subject.\n\nFor the summary, I need to highlight the main points: the updates in BTP Cockpit, Financial Closing, and other services, their impact on users, and the importance of these changes for compliance and efficiency.\n\nThe importance rating should be high since these updates affect multiple departments and are critical for system functionality. Maybe a 9.5 because they're recent and have significant implications.\n\nIn the detailed findings, I'll break down each major update. For example, the BTP Cockpit enhancements, the Financial Closing app changes, improvements in Document AI, and Datasphere updates. Each finding needs a summary and explanation, citing the relevant records.\n\nDate range is from the earliest 2023-10-04 to the latest 2025-08-15. I need to check all the dates in the sources to confirm.\n\nI also need to ensure that each data reference is correctly cited with the record IDs and dates. Make sure not to include more than 5 IDs per reference and use \"+more\" if needed.\n\nFinally, structure the JSON as per the example, ensuring all sections are included and formatted correctly without any markdown.

View Commercial Information: This new tab allows global account admins and viewers to view the commercial source of their entitlements. This feature is not available for trial accounts.        Changed layout in Service Assignments page: The Service Overview option has been moved out of the Service dropdown menu and now has its own All Services view (tab) in the Service Assignments page. As a result, the Service Assignments page now has two views (tabs):      All Services: Provides an overview of all available service entitlements of your global account.      Assignments by Service: Allows you to choose specific services and see how their service plans are assigned to subaccounts and directories within your global account.          Improved visibility of free service plans: When configuring assignments in the Entity Assignments page, the Add Service Plans dialog box now displays the \"\"Always Free\"\" and \"\"Free Tier\"\" labels for service plans falling into these categories. This enhancement allows you to easily identify which plans are not charged for consumption.      Enhanced Service Assignments page: In the Service Assignments page, under the All Services view, we have added a new column called Assigned To. It shows you the total number of directories and subaccounts to which each service plan is assigned in your global account. You can click on the links in this column to quickly navigate to the selected service view and display more details about these assignments.      Access to service-related links: Documentation links, support info links, and SAP Discovery Center links, have been added when available. These links can be accessed in the Add Service Plans dialog box in the Entity Assignments page and in the main table of both Entitlements pages by clicking on the new    (Service Details) icon for any service listed under the Service Technical Name column.      Improved search functionality: In both Entitlements pages, the Search field has been relocated to the top of the page. You can now search for more than one term. Also, when you start typing, you get a list of suggestions. This change makes it more convenient for you to quickly search for specific entitlements or services.

With this enhancement, we've added entitlement source information, which displays how each entitled plan was added to your global account. This addition allows global account admins and viewers to gain a better understanding of the relationship between contractual service entitlements and the technical assets (services and plans) in your global account. This functionality is highly valuable, for example, if your account has multiple subscriptions from different packages for the same service plan, or your global account is entitled to service plans that are derived from both the subscription-based and consumption-based models.  Here's what you can expect:      Entitlements  Service Assignments page: Look for the Show commercial info toggle button. By turning on this option, you will see these new commercially-oriented columns added to the main table: Entitlement Source, Licensed Quantity, and Commercial Type.      Entitlements  Entity Assignments page:    Find the new View Commercial Info tab, which provides comprehensive commercial information.      Add Service Plans toggle button. By turning on this dialog box: Each service plan now includes an expandable Entitlements Sources section. This feature is accessible when configuring your assignments in the Manage Assignments view.          Additionally, we've introduced an Entitlement Source filter in both pages, allowing you to easily list plans based on their source of entitlement.   Note that this commercial information is not available for trial accounts.

The new page offers a new look and exciting capabilities focusing on enhancing the cost transparency of the service consumption in your global account. All the features in the old Usage Analytics page are still available in the new page but may work a little differently now.  These are the new capabilities you can expect:      Billing Verification: Verify billing accurately using data and terminology incorporated from your monthly balance statement.

Direct Access to Filtered Views: Bookmark your filters and search queries for quicker direct access and easier sharing with colleagues.

The successor app covers all business logs: those that were already created before its release and those that have been created since then or will be created in the future.
