The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various technical updates and changes related to SAP services, like credential types, security measures, and software updates. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the records, the main components are services like Authorization and Trust Management Service, Application Autoscaler, Pricing Service, and others. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry, ABAP, Kyma, Neo, etc. The main themes are security updates (like moving to x509 certificates), deprecations (like instance-secret), and new features (like staged deployments).\n\nNext, the title should reflect the main focus. Since the data revolves around security and credential changes, maybe something like \"SAP Security and Credential Management Updates in 2025\".\n\nThe summary needs to highlight the transition from older credential types to more secure ones, the deprecation of certain services, and the impact on developers. The importance rating would be high because these changes affect security and require action from developers.\n\nFor detailed findings, I'll list key points: the shift to x509, deprecation of instance-secret, staged deployments, end-of-life for certain service plans, and updates to Java buildpacks. Each finding needs an explanation with data references. \n\nI need to ensure that each section follows the grounding rules, citing the relevant records. The date range should cover from the earliest valid date (2024-07-25) to the latest (2026-04-01). \n\nI should check that all the required sections are included and formatted correctly as JSON.

This default will be changed to x509 (instead of binding-secret).   Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change.

The target audience of the change is developers:   Until now, service bindings of the Application Autoscaler always provided url, username, and password in the credentials section. These credentials could be used to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using the “Basic” HTTP Authentication security scheme.  What changes  We are going to remove the support for “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API.   To enable you to prepare and test this transition, we are introducing a new parameter credential-type, which can be used to proactively prepare for the removal.  Note  Alternatively, you have the option to change the behavior up to three months later.   If no credential types are defined in the service binding parameters, the Application Autoscaler service applies a default. This default is for now binding-secret.       When the credential-type binding-secret is chosen, url, username, and password will be provided in the credentials section.       When the credential-type x509 is chosen, url, username and password are not provided in the credentials section.       Regardless of which credential-type is active, it is always possible access to the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using mTLS, see Defining a Custom Metric.  On 2025-01-22, we plan to change the credential-type default to x509, but you will still be able to explicitly specify the credential-type binding-secret.   Starting, 2025-04-30 only the credential-type x509 will be valid, either set explicitly, or by default, if not set explicitly.  Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.

The target audience of the change are developers.  If no credential types are defined in the application security descriptor, the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service applies a default. This default will be changed to binding-secret (instead of instance-secret).   Action  Check whether you are affected by the change. The change only affects new service instances (including reuse services) if all of the following prerequisites are true:      Allowed credential types are not configured in the security descriptor.      No parameters are passed during the creation of a binding or service key.      If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the binding-secret credential type before this change is activated. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the following credential types in the application security descriptor:    [binding-secret\"\", \"\"x509\"\"]    It has the same effect as the planned change.    Recommendation  We strongly recommend to configure binding-secret and x509 as allowed credential types (or x509 alone) in conjunction with a regular credential rotation (see Service Instance Secrets).

Currently, if the xsenableasyncservice attribute is not configured in your application security descriptor, the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service creates and updates service instances synchronously. This default changes to asynchronous. The change affects existing as well as new service instances of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service.  This change conforms with the new defaults of the Cloud Foundry command line interface (see https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/v8.html), which come with cf CLI v8.

This means that the DigiCert Root CA platform domain certificate will be signed by DigiCert Global Root G3 instead of DigiCert Global Root G2.   The switch will happen in individual regions starting as of April 2026.  The following platform domains are affected:    *.<Region.Domain>      *.dispatcher.<Region.Domain>      *.cert.<Region.Domain>      *.static.<Region.Domain>      *.vms.<Region.Domain>      *.netweaver.ondemand.com      connectivitynotification.<Region.Domain>      connectivitytunnel.<Region.Domain>      If you control the trust stores of your client, you must ensure that the new root CA is added to the certificate trust store. The client must include the old and the new root CA.   For an overview of all region domains, see: Regions and Hosts Available for the Neo Environment    Action: It is possible that older clients or operating systems do not trust the new root CA, which can cause certificate validation or handshake errors. Within the transition period, it is recommended that you verify that your clients are trusting DigiCert Global Root G3.\nAction: Recommended\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-09-18\nValid as Of: 2026-04-01\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2 ---\nComponent: Authorization and Trust Management Service\nEnvironment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other\nTitle: Automatic Signing Key Rotation for Access Tokens as Default\nDescription: Automatic rotation of the signing key for access tokens is enabled for new subaccounts by default. SAP BTP rotates the signing key periodically.    Note  Customers can still enable or disable automatic signing key rotation.    Action  If you plan on deploying custom applications to these new subaccounts, make sure they don't rely on a manually configured token signing key or the signing key from the binding or service key. To test an application, enable automatic key rotation in an existing subaccount. The first key rotation should occur in within 48 hours.

You are affected by this change in the following cases:      You have explicitly configured the credential type instance-secret in your security descriptor.      Your service instance was created before 12 November 2024 without the explicit configuration of credential types in your security descriptor.      This change has the following impact:        Creating or updating service instances with the credential type instance-secret in the security descriptor fail.      Creating bindings or service keys with the credential type instance-secret fail.      Existing instance secrets are removed or rejected if they haven't been used for more than 3 months.      For service instances created before 12 November 2024 without the explicit configuration of credential types in your security descriptor, the service instance update changes the default binding type from instance-secret to binding-secret.      New bindings or service keys for other BTP services can't contain instance secrets.        Action  Instead of using the instance-secret credential type, applications and services use the binding-secret credential type (see Migrate from Instance Secrets to Binding Secrets) or x509 (see Retrieving Access Tokens with Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)).  To test your application with these credential types, update your security descriptor to set the credential type to [\"\"binding-secret\"\", \"\"x509\"\"].
