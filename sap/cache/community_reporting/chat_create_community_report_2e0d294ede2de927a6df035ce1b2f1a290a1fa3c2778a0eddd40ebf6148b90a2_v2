The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various records related to SAP components, their updates, deprecations, and new features. The main entities here seem to be SAP products like Joule, SAP Build Process Automation, Cloud Identity Services, etc., along with their environments and changes.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the records, Joule is mentioned multiple times with updates related to data centers, authentication methods, and use cases. Then there's SAP Build Process Automation, which has new features like support for multiple outcomes in conditions. Cloud Identity Services have several updates, including deprecations of SAML and new OIDC support. Also, there are mentions of deprecations like the MTA build tool and Container-Based Applications pipeline.\n\nNext, the relationships between these entities. Joule is part of the Cloud Foundry environment and has dependencies on Identity Authentication (IAS) and XSUAA. The migration from SAML to OIDC affects multiple components, including Joule and Cloud Identity Services. SAP Build Process Automation and SAP Task Center are related through the Intelligent Recommendations feature. The deprecation notices link different components, like the MTA build tool affecting Continuous Integration & Delivery.\n\nFor the summary, I need to highlight the main changes and their implications. The importance rating should reflect the criticality of these updates, especially the deprecations and migrations which require immediate action. The findings should cover key points like Joule's migration, new features in SAP Build, Cloud Identity Services updates, deprecations, and the expansion of data centers.\n\nI need to ensure that each finding is supported by the data references, citing the relevant records. The date range should cover from the earliest valid date (2022-01-01) to the latest (2025-01-28). Also, check that the JSON structure is correct, with proper sections and no markdown.

SAML trust configurations are deprecated for user-interactive authentication in customer-owned accounts regardless of the specific identity provider. The CIO Guide: Identity Lifecycle in SAP Landscapes provides the guidance for this deprecation. We recommend a single trust configuration per subaccount with SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. This configuration enables direct usage of SAP Cloud Identity Services by applications and services, meaning without the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service. Such direct usage of SAP Cloud Identity Services is the recommended programming model for new applications and services.  The deprecation doesn't apply to the following cases:      Principal propagation using the SAML Bearer flow. An example for this is an SAML trust configuration to accept API calls on behalf of users from another subaccount using a destination.      Trust between a partner-owned subaccount and a customer-owned tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services. OIDC support for this constellation is planned, but isn't possible yet. Until then, use SAML and make sure the trusted identity provider is already SAP Cloud Identity Services and not any other identity provider.      Trust between your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant and your corporate identity provider.      Note  This announcement has no bearing on the use of SAML for other SAP products or other use cases within the SAP BTP family of solutions.   Existing SAML trust configurations affected by the deprecation will still be tolerated after the deprecation date and continue to work. Support will be restricted to security-related fixes.   Impact  When you create a new trust configuration for interactive login, choose a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services with the OIDC protocol. Use Establish Trust in the SAP BTP cockpit or the btp create security/trust command of the btp CLI. For more information, see the documentation about Establish Trust. If you have a corporate identity provider,\",1111\n511,\" configurations affected by the deprecation will still be tolerated after the deprecation date and continue to work. Support will be restricted to security-related fixes.   Impact  When you create a new trust configuration for interactive login, choose a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services with the OIDC protocol. Use Establish Trust in the SAP BTP cockpit or the btp create security/trust command of the btp CLI. For more information, see the documentation about Establish Trust. If you have a corporate identity provider, use SAP Cloud Identity Services as a proxy and then connect corporate identity providers with SAML or OIDC.  We recommend migrating existing SAML trusts according to the documentation Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect Trust with SAP Cloud Identity Services, however this isn't mandatory until the deprecation date. The following cases are covered:        Trust to SAP Cloud Identity Services: A simple change of protocol.      Trust to another identity provider: SAP Cloud Identity Services is inserted as a proxy between the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service and your corporate identity provider.   Note  The restriction of a single Identity Authentication OIDC trust per subaccount also applies here.      \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-05-28\nValid as Of: 2024-12-31\nVersion: 2412b\n\n--- Record 1686 ---\nComponent: Continuous Integration & Delivery\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Deprecation of the Container-Based Applications Pipeline\nDescription: The Container-Based Applications pipeline has been deprecated and will be removed from the service on December 31st, 2024.
