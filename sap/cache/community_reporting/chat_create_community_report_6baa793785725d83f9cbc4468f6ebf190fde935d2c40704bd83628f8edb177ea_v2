Looking at the records, there are several components like SAP Task Center, Kyma Runtime, SAP Document AI, Cloud Identity Services, etc. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry, Kyma, and Neo. The main themes seem to be updates, deprecations, new features, and changes in configurations.\n\nNext, the title should be specific and include representative entities.

Mentioning the key components and the need for adjustments by users would be important.\n\nThe importance rating: Since there are several required actions and deprecations, the impact is significant. Maybe a 8.5, as it's high but not the highest possible.\n\nRating explanation should tie the rating to the number of required actions and the potential disruption from deprecations.\n\nDetailed findings need to be 5-10 insights. Let's see:\n\n1. Telemetry index changes affecting OpenTelemetry users. This is from record 156.\n2. Native sidecars in Istio module 1.22, affecting Kyma Runtime. Records 18 and 1895.\n3. Deprecation of Manage Country/Region Groups app in favor of Manage Company Code Groups. Record 1898.\n4. New features in SAP Task Center like email notifications and search optimization. Records 2282 and 1891.\n5. Updates to Kyma Runtime's Telemetry module. Record 2286.\n6. Changes in SAP Omnichannel Promotion Pricing regarding loyalty points. Records 2287, 2289.\n7. Deprecation of the disable-external-name-alias annotation in Istio. Records 2283, 1892, 1895.\n8. Off-cycle upgrades in Cloud Identity Services. Record 2285.\n9. Fixes in Continuous Integration & Delivery for blue-green deployment. Record 2284.\n10. New properties for optimizing search performance in SAP Task Center. Record 1891.\n\nEach finding needs a summary and explanation with data references. I have to make sure to cite the correct record IDs and date ranges. Also, check the dates for the latest revisions and valid dates to set the date range from 2024-09-05 to 2025-10-29.\n\nNeed to ensure that the JSON structure is correct, with proper commas and brackets.

They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you are using the OpenTelemetry logs/metrics feature and rely on the old index suffix on your custom OpenSearch content / queries. In such cases you need to adapt:  Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.    If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern (e.g. metrics-otel-v1-*) instead of targeting individual indexes.      Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.    \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-10-29\nValid as Of: 2025-10-29\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 18 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: Native sidecars enabled by default with Istio module 1.22\nDescription: With version 1.27, Istio changed the default behavior of attaching Istio sidecar proxy containers, which now run as native sidecars. This approach resolves network connection issues that arise when regular Istio sidecar proxy containers are not ready at the same time as application containers or init containers. Additionally, regular sidecar containers prevent Pods from finishing, for example, in the case of Jobs. If you use the Kubernetes API, an istio-proxy container running as a native sidecar appears in the initContainers list instead of the containers list in a Pod's spec. To learn more, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  To allow more time for Kyma runtime users to adjust to this change, the Istio module in version 1.21 disables the default use of native sidecars. Although Istio module 1.21 installs Istio updated to version 1.27, by default, Istio sidecar proxies are still deployed as regular sidecar containers. With version 1.22 of the Istio module, Istio proxy sidecars will be deployed by default as native sidecars.   The Istio module 1.22 is scheduled to be rolled out to the fast channel on October 8, 2025, and to the regular channel on October 22, 2025.   To use native sidecars before the Istio module 1.22 is released, you must annotate specific Pods or Pod templates with the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\".  To continue using regular sidecars instead of native sidecars after the Istio module 1.22 is released, choose one of these solutions:  Disable the use of native sidecars for a particular workload by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" on a Pod or in the Pod template.  Disable the feature globally for all workloads by setting the compatibilityMode field in the Istio CR to true. See Compatibility Mode.  Required action: Test how your application and the tooling (such as automations or monitoring) behave when the Istio sidecar proxy runs as a native sidecar by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"true\"\" for all your workloads. This is especially important if you have implemented any workarounds for problems caused by the Istio sidecar proxies' lifecycle or if you use automation or monitoring tools to observe the istio-proxy containers. If everything works fine, you can:  Leave the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\", so that you immediately benefit from native sidecar functionality regardless of the Istio module's upgrades.  Remove the annotation and rely on the default settings.  In case of issues, you can explicitly set the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" to use regular sidecar containers until you fix the problem. This guarantees that nothing will change when native sidecars are enabled by default by the Istio module 1.22.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-09-05\nValid as Of: 2025-10-22\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 19 ---\nComponent: Application for Data Replication and Administration\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Configure External Tax Providers\nDescription: There is a new screen to configure the connection to external tax providers.
