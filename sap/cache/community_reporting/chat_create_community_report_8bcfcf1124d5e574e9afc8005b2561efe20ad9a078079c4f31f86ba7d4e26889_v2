This was caused by a changed default value introduced in Tomcat 9.0.90. With the upgrade to Tomcat 9.0.95, the problem has been solved. This was a regression in 2.17.1.  When upgrading a shadow instance, the master high availability (HA) port got lost during the upgrade. This was a regression in 2.17.1.  Pressing CapsLock when entering a password into Cloud Connector's login screen deleted the password characters that were entered so far. This was caused by a regression in UI5 Core 1.108.30 that was used in 2.17.1.  In the connection monitor details view the active requests were not showing the user that is invoking the service, even if the user is actually known. This was a regression introduced in 2.16.0.  Due to a faulty consistency check, the custom regions list contained all the known regions that were in use on the Cloud Connector. This illegal state has been corrected.  When using a dedicated HA port and resetting the HA settings on a shadow, the shadow's UI port within the HA information was wrongly set to the HA port. As a consequence, after connecting again to a master, it was not possible to open the shadow UI using the button in the master UI in the High Availability screen.  \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-10-31\nValid as Of: 2024-10-31\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2006 ---\nComponent: Connectivity\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Neo\nTitle: Cloud Connector 2.17.2 - Enhancements\nDescription: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.17.2 provides the following enhancements:    Introduced a CapsLock warning on all password input fields. Previously, such a warning was only shown on the login screen.  Cloud Connector does no longer allow to upload UI certificates from a P12 file that include the KeyUsage certsigning. Such certificates are not accepted by all browsers for identifying a server.  The connection check for access control entries is now allowed for all authenticated users.  When opening TCP connections successfully, an audit log entry is written that access to the system has been allowed.  \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-10-31\nValid as Of: 2024-10-31\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2007 ---\nComponent: Connectivity\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Destination Service - REST API\nDescription: The \"\"Get All Destinations\"\" endpoint of the service's REST API now\",471\n622,\"--- Record 2221 ---\nComponent: Identity Provisioning\nEnvironment: Neo\nTitle: SAP Ariba Central Invoice Management connector\nDescription: Identity Provisioning supports the SAP Ariba Central Invoice Management connector.

This is possible by including a condition for filtering the users by group display name of their assigned groups. If the dc.group.prefix is set, only users assigned to groups that contain in their display name the set specific prefix will be provisioned. In case the property is not set, all users are provisioned to SAP Data Custodian, regardless of the group display name of their assigned groups.

Previously, it was not possible to create or delete groups; it was expected that groups already exist in the target system, allowing Identity Provisioning to only update their members. Now, creating, updating, and deleting groups follow the standard processes.
