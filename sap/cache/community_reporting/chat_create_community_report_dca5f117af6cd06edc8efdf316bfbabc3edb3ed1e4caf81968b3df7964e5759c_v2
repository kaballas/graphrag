The data includes several records related to SAP's various components and updates. \n\nLooking at the records, they all seem to be announcements or updates related to SAP's technology stack, specifically around security, cloud services, and administrative tools. The key entities here are the different SAP components like Authorization and Trust Management, Cloud Logging, SAP BTP Cockpit, etc. \n\nThe goal is to structure this into a report with sections like title, summary, importance rating, findings, and date range. The title should be specific, maybe something like \"SAP Technology Updates and Security Enhancements in 2024-2025\". \n\nFor the summary, I need to highlight the main points: security changes, cloud service improvements, and administrative controls. The importance rating should be high since these updates affect security and operations, which are critical for any organization.\n\nThe detailed findings should list key insights. Each finding needs a summary and explanation, citing the relevant records. For example, the OAuth redirect URI change in record 132 is a security update. Then, the Cloud Logging index sizing change in record 1019 improves stability. The opt-in control for subaccount deletion in 1020 adds safeguards. Other records mention new features like Visual cloud functions and Kubernetes operators in Automation Pilot.\n\nI need to ensure that each finding references the correct record IDs and dates.

We're going to make the following change for security reasons. Redirect URIs without wildcards only match the exact entry.  If you've deployed custom web applications and defined OAuth redirect URIs without wildcards (*), the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service accepts arbitrary subdomains and paths.    Example  The allowed URI https://myhost.com matches also the following specific values:      https://myhost.com/somepath      https://somesubdomain.myhost.com      This isn't allowed anymore. Only https://myhost.com is accepted after the change.    Action  For affected applications, update the redirect URIs in the application security descriptor with the specific URI and/or wildcards. This ensures that they match the specific URIs during user logon after the stricter rules are in effect.

The overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters will be improved by proper index sizing, especially in high-ingest and huge storage volume scenarios. To achieve this, we will switch from daily indexes to the index rollover approach targeting the updated release date - 17. April 2025.  With this change, the index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., logs-json-2024.11.19), but a six-digit number (e.g., logs-json-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you run queries against the old index suffix. In such cases you need to adapt:      Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.          If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern instead of targeting individual indexes.          Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.      This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-02-10\nValid as Of: 2025-04-17\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1020 ---\nComponent: SAP BTP Cockpit\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Neo\nTitle: Opt-In Control for Force Deletion of Subaccounts in SAP BTP\nDescription: To prevent accidental force deletion of subaccounts containing content, SAP BTP introduces new safeguards:    Global account administrators must now opt in to allow force deletion of subaccounts via a dedicated global account setting. This setting is located under the Subaccounts section in the global account settings and is labeled Enable Subaccounts Force Deletion. For more details on how to access and manage global account settings, see  Managing Global Accounts Using the Cockpit (Cloud Foundry) and  Managing Global Accounts Using the Cockpit (Neo environment).       Force deletion is only allowed for subaccounts not marked as Used for production. If a subaccount is marked as Used for production force deletion is always prohibited, regardless of the global setting.

We are doing so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  While the change has already been rolled out on the regions br10 and eu20 in November 2023, the remaining regions are scheduled to follow on February 22, 2024.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates/mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  Action:  If you are using client certificates/mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command: openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see 3333978 .
