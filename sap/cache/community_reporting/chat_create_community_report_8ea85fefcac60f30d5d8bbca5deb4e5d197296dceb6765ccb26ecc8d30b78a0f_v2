Use Establish Trust in the SAP BTP cockpit or the btp create security/trust command of the btp CLI. For more information, see the documentation about Establish Trust. If you have a corporate identity provider, use SAP Cloud Identity Services as a proxy and then connect corporate identity providers with SAML or OIDC.
