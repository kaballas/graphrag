This means that the DigiCert Root CA platform domain certificate will be signed by DigiCert Global Root G3 instead of DigiCert Global Root G2.   The switch will happen in individual regions starting as of April 2026.  The following platform domains are affected:    *.<Region.Domain>      *.dispatcher.<Region.Domain>      *.cert.<Region.Domain>      *.static.<Region.Domain>      *.vms.<Region.Domain>      *.netweaver.ondemand.com      connectivitynotification.<Region.Domain>      connectivitytunnel.<Region.Domain>      If you control the trust stores of your client, you must ensure that the new root CA is added to the certificate trust store. The client must include the old and the new root CA.   For an overview of all region domains, see: Regions and Hosts Available for the Neo Environment    Action: It is possible that older clients or operating systems do not trust the new root CA, which can cause certificate validation or handshake errors.

Your service instance was created before 12 November 2024 without the explicit configuration of credential types in your security descriptor.      This change has the following impact:        Creating or updating service instances with the credential type instance-secret in the security descriptor fail.      Creating bindings or service keys with the credential type instance-secret fail.      Existing instance secrets are removed or rejected if they haven't been used for more than 3 months.      For service instances created before 12 November 2024 without the explicit configuration of credential types in your security descriptor, the service instance update changes the default binding type from instance-secret to binding-secret.      New bindings or service keys for other BTP services can't contain instance secrets.        Action  Instead of using the instance-secret credential type, applications and services use the binding-secret credential type (see Migrate from Instance Secrets to Binding Secrets) or x509 (see Retrieving Access Tokens with Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)).
