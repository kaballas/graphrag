Looking at the components, Cloud Transport Management, Kyma Runtime, Data Space Integration, Mobile Services, and Connectivity seem prominent. These are the main areas where changes and updates are happening.\n\nNext, the relationships between these entities. For example, Cloud Transport Management has multiple updates related to transport nodes, logs, and tags. Kyma Runtime deals with API Gateway versions and migrations. Data Space Integration has version updates and new operators. Mobile Services has new features like offline downloads and logout services. Connectivity introduces new destination service features.\n\nThe summary should highlight how these components are interconnected, maybe through shared environments like Cloud Foundry or Kyma. The importance rating would be high because these updates affect multiple areas of the system, indicating their significance.\n\nFor detailed findings, I need to list key insights. Each insight should have a summary and explanation, citing the relevant records. For example, enhancements in Cloud Transport Management with tags and logs, API Gateway upgrades in Kyma, Data Space Integration's new features, Mobile Services improvements, and Connectivity updates.\n\nI need to ensure that each finding references the correct record IDs and dates.

Additionally, the planned deletion of v1beta1 for the end of May will also be postponed. A new target date will be announced in the future.  Required action: Migrate all your APIRule custom resources (CRs) to version v2.      To migrate your APIRule CRs from version v2alpha1 to version v2, you must update the version in APIRule CRs’ metadata.  To migrate your APIRule CRs from version v1beta1 to v2, follow the procedure described in the blog posts:   APIRule migration - noAuth and jwt handlers  APIRule migration - Ory Oathkeeper based OAuth2 handlers    For more information, see Changes Introduced in APIRule v2alpha1 and v2.

The new CRD allows you to expose your workloads using one of the three supported access strategies: jwt, noAuth, and extAuth. The noAuth access strategy provides a simple configuration for exposing workloads over the specified HTTP methods. The jwt access strategy allows you to secure your workload by defining Istio JWT configuration and the extAuth access strategy allows for providing custom authentication and authorization logic. For more information, see APIRule Custom Resource.  Additionally, version 3.0.2 contains the following fixes:  We've fixed the behavior of in-cluster connectivity when using JWT handler in APIRule. Now, in-cluster connectivity is blocked.  Now, when you create an APIRule with the noAuth access strategy, it is validated if the target workload has an Istio sidecar proxy injected.  \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-05-05\nValid as Of: 2025-05-05\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 966 ---\nComponent: Data Space Integration\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Assignees Column Available in Company Policies\nDescription: In the list of company policies (Configure  Data Spaces), the column Assignees now shows you how many clients are already assigned to the company policy.
