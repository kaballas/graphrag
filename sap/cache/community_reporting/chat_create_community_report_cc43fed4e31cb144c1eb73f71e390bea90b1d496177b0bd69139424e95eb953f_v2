So far, users can query data in exposed CDS view entities, and this was a read-only scenario, where SELECT statements could be used.   Now, the SQL service can also be used to change data in exposed writable CDS view entities using INSERT and DELETE statements. Use cases for INSERT and DELETE in such a data integration scenario include: full replication of data from another system into the ABAP system or bringing data into staging tables that will be later used for your custom ABAP coding.
