The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various SAP components and their updates, mainly focusing on Joule, Cloud Integration for Data Services, and other SAP BTP services. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. The main one here is Joule, which has multiple updates and enhancements. Then there's Cloud Integration for Data Services, which has documentation updates and environment-specific changes. Other components like SAP Task Center and Intelligent Situation Automation are also mentioned, but they might be less central.\n\nThe title should reflect the main community, which seems to be around Joule and its integrations. Maybe \"SAP Joule and Cloud Integration Enhancements in 2024-2025\" as it covers the main components and the time frame.\n\nFor the summary, I need to highlight the key relationships: Joule's migration to IAS, new features, and the Cloud Integration updates. Also, note the deprecation of some services. The importance rating would be high because these updates affect multiple areas and require user actions, which is critical for SAP users.\n\nIn the detailed findings, I'll break down Joule's migration, new use cases, document grounding, data center availability, and the Cloud Integration documentation changes. Each finding needs to reference the relevant records. The date range should cover from the earliest (2024-02-07) to the latest (2025-09-25).\n\nI need to make sure each section follows the grounding rules, citing the record IDs properly.

Previously, your confirmation was required before viewing their information.    In the use cases \"\"View peers\"\", \"\"View direct reports\"\", and \"\"View manager\"\", inactive users are now removed from the search\",917\n142,\" Joule application has been migrated to SAP Identity Authentication (IAS) and supports IAS multi-tenancy in addition to XSUAA. Joule now requires a trust configuration of type OpenID Connect with your Identity Authentication tenant. SAML-trusted IdPs for Joule will be supported for a short period after which the trust configuration of type OpenID Connect will be required.  If you are using SAML-trusted IdPs for Joule, you need to change the SAML trust configuration to an OIDC configuration. For more information, see Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect Trust with Identity Authentication.   Ensure that you have configured the trusted domains in Identity Authentication as described in Configure Trusted Domains in Identity Authentication.Note  No action is needed if you are using OIDC trust set up for Joule.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-04-16\nValid as Of: 2024-04-16\nVersion: Cloud\n\n\",711\n282,\"--- Record 51 ---\nComponent: Cloud Integration for Data Services\nEnvironment: Kyma,Neo\nTitle: Documentation update only: Environment Indicators in User Documentation\nDescription: In support of the release of SAP Cloud Integration for data services on SAP BTP Kyma runtime and with the service's being in use simultaneously on the Neo environment, indicators have been added in various places within the user documentation to reflect when information pertains to one environment or the other.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Database and Data Management\nLatest Revision: 2025-09-24\nValid as Of: 2025-09-25\nVersion: 2509\n\n--- Record 52 ---\nComponent: Cloud Integration for Data Services\nEnvironment: Kyma,Neo\nTitle: Documentation update only: User Activation Emails\nDescription: Finish Setting Up a Standard User has been updated to reflect that, when using SAP Identity Authentication (IAS) on the Neo environment or Kyma runtime, SAP Cloud Integration for data services does not send emails to notify users when they have been activated.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Database and Data Management\nLatest Revision: 2025-09-19\nValid as Of: 2025-09-25\nVersion: 2509\n\n--- Record 53 ---\nComponent: Cloud Integration for Data Services\nEnvironment: Kyma,Neo\nTitle: IBP JDBC Supported on the Neo Environment Only\nDescription: IBP JDBC and other cloud applications such as SAP Lumira Cloud and SAP HANA are not supported on SAP Cloud Integration for data services on Kyma runtime.
