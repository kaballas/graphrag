The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data consists of various SAP-related updates and enhancements across different components and environments. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the data to identify key entities and their relationships. The main components mentioned are SAP Document AI, SAP Task Center, Cloud Foundry, Kyma Runtime, Data Quality Services, Integration Suite, and others. Each entry has a component, environment, title, description, and other metadata.\n\nThe goal is to structure this into a report with sections like title, summary, importance rating, findings, etc. The title should be specific, maybe something like \"SAP Cloud Foundry and Kyma Runtime Enhancements and Updates (2024-2025)\" to capture the main environments and time frame.\n\nFor the summary, I need to highlight the key areas: improvements in document AI, task management, data quality, and runtime environments. The importance rating should reflect the significance of these updates, probably around 8.5 since they're critical for SAP's cloud services.\n\nIn the detailed findings, I'll list key insights. For example, SAP Document AI updates, Task Center improvements, Data Quality Services enhancements, Kyma Runtime changes, and Integration Suite features. Each finding needs a summary and explanation, citing relevant records. \n\nI need to ensure that each explanation includes data references with the record IDs. Also, the date range should cover from the earliest (2024-01-01) to the latest (2025-06-12). \n\nI should check for any overlaps or connections between the components. For instance, multiple entries mention Cloud Foundry and Kyma Runtime, indicating their importance. Also, the Data Quality Services have several enhancements across different regions, which is a key point.\n\nI need to avoid making up information and stick strictly to the provided data.

A cause exception similar to Caused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: class com.sap.scc.util.LogUtils (in unnamed module @0x2d019f4f) cannot access class sun.security.validator.ValidatorException (in module java.base) can no longer occur, when running the Cloud Connector with SapMachine 11, 17, or 21.  In a shadow instance, the message \"\"LDAP changes will not take effect unless Cloud Connector is restarted\"\" will now be shown only if the LDAP configuration has indeed been changed.  After an upgrade of an instance using both, a separate HA (high availability) port and multiple LDAP instances, the LDAP configuration did not work anymore. The previous configuration got corrupted and as a consequence, the trace was wrongly showing \"\"Unable to determine whether password should be changed for user sccadmin\"\".  Alerts about a successful switch of roles are now no longer popping up again after having deleted these alerts. This was a regression in 2.18.0.  The setting for user OID mapping for client certificate authentication did not survive a restart, it was stored and shown correctly in the UI. However, for the logon always \"\"CN\"\" was used again after a restart.  After an upgrade, an email configuration that used TLS, lost its TLS attribute. This was a regression in 2.18.0.  The upgrade now ignores corrupted zip files (for example, file size 0) in the log directory so the Cloud Connector can be started properly after an upgrade.  Fixed a wrong authorization check, see also SAP security note 3611345.  \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-06-12\nValid as Of: 2025-06-12\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 658 ---\nComponent: Connectivity\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Neo\nTitle: Cloud Connector 2.18.1 - Enhancements\nDescription: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.18.1 provides the following enhancements:    The JVM parameters NewSize, MaxNewSize, SurvivorRatio, and TargetSurvivorRatio were dropped, as the G1 garbage collector works better without those settings.

Action: If the UI of the consuming application allows it, it is recommended to always read the configuration results during interactive configuration without the possible values of characteristics. This can be achieved by using the parameter $select omitting the parameter value possibleValue when creating or reading a configuration. Only when the user clicks on a UI element, like a dropdown list box, that requires to render the possible values on the UI, the possible values should be read for that characteristic using the new endpoint. This will improve performance especially when AVC Forwarding is enabled.
