The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various SAP-related updates and announcements, mostly technical and related to cloud services, regions, and security measures.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the sources, the main components are SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform), Cloud Foundry, Connectivity, Region management, and various services like the Cloud Connector, Destination Service, and others. The entities also include specific regions like Frankfurt, AWS regions, and technical aspects like IP addresses, TLS configurations, and certificate management.\n\nNext, the relationships between these entities. For example, the Connectivity component is involved with Cloud Connector and Destination Service, which are related to IP address management and security protocols. Regions like Frankfurt and AWS regions are linked to updates about IP ranges and IPv6 support. The ABAP Environment and SAP Build Process Automation are other components with their own updates.\n\nThe importance rating should reflect the criticality of these updates. Since many of the entries are marked as \"Required\" or \"Action: Required,\" especially regarding security and IP address configurations, the importance is high. The rating might be around 8.5 to 9.0, considering the impact on system security and compliance.\n\nFor the detailed findings, I need to highlight key points like the expansion of regions (Frankfurt EU access), IPv6 support in AWS regions, deprecation of weak certificates, and the addition of new IP ranges. Each finding should be supported by the relevant records. For example, the IPv6 updates are mentioned in records 85, 234, and 399. The deprecation of weak client certificates is in records 3382, 3951, and 3841.\n\nI also need to ensure the date range covers all the relevant dates from the data. The earliest date is 2023-11-02 and the latest is 2025-09-19. However, some records mention future dates like October 2025, but the valid as of dates might be up to 2025-09-19. So the date range would be from 2023-11-02 to 2025-09-19.\n\nFinally, structuring the JSON with the title, summary, rating, explanation, findings, and date range. The title should reflect the main focus, which is SAP's technical updates and regional expansions. The summary should encapsulate the key aspects like security, region management, and IP address changes. Each finding needs a concise summary and detailed explanation with data references.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"SAP BTP Technical Updates and Regional Expansions (2023-2025)\",\n    \"summary\": \"This report outlines SAP's key technical updates and regional developments across its Business Technology Platform (BTP) ecosystem, focusing on security enhancements, IP address management, and new region availability.

This was a regression introduced with version 2.15.1.The issue has been fixed.Note  Creating backups with the REST API was not affected.    Selecting a subaccount in the administration UI might have failed. This happened if there are more than 100 subaccounts hosted on the Cloud Connector instance and when filtering the subaccount list. In this case, a completely different one was selected when choosing the subaccount. This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  During an upgrade via RPM it could happen that the UI after the initial login screen was not loading. In the traces of the Cloud Connector, you could see many messages telling that a JAR file could not be found that was existing only before the upgrade. This could be resolved by a restart of the daemon only. The issue was caused by another issue in upgrade processing, which has been improved to avoid the erroneous situation.  Avoid a NullPointerException when receiving a close request in RFC protocol processing. This could lead to wrong values for the connection monitor for RFC connections. The call stack of the exception started with java.lang.NullPointerException: while trying to invoke the method com.sap.core.connectivity.spi.processing.TargetHost.connectionProtocol() of a null object loaded from local variable 'target' at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.updateNonRequestBased(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:109) at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.reportCloseConnection(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:96)  Corrupted subaccounts could not be loaded properly. As a consequence, it was impossible to delete them from the administration UI. In some cases, they even did not appear in the list of subaccounts, but were existing, so trying to add such a subaccount would fail.This issue has been fixed.      Self-signed system certificates containing SANs need to have all CA attributes, which is not desired for the system certificate, and hence it does not have them.

We will do so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openssl.org%2Fdocs%2Fman3.0%2Fman3%2FSSL_CTX_set_security_level.html%23DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  The change will be rolled out gradually, starting with the region br10 on November 29 and the region eu20 on November 30, 2023. All other regions are planned to be updated in January 2024. Further details regarding the timelines for the remaining regions will be announced through this channel in a timely manner.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates / mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  If you are using client certificates / mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command:openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see SAP Note 3333978 .  Action:  Please contact the issuer of the certificate with the command you executed and the output you got and request a certificate that passes the verification.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2023-11-02\nValid as Of: 2023-11-02\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3952 ---\nComponent: SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Removal of .NET, Ruby, and R Buildpacks\nDescription: This the final reminder that the .NET, Ruby, and R offline buildpacks have been deprecated and are scheduled to be removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment on November 16, 2023.

This is a reminder that the range will start to be used from October 8, 2025.   Actions:      If your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules, please adapt your configuration before October 8, 2025 by allowlisting the specified NAT IP address range.   Remove the following IP ranges from allowlisting between October 20, 2025 and October 24, 2025 if your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules. This is necessary because these IP ranges will be released from SAP and returned to AWS for redistribution, which changes their availability. Removing these ranges helps prevent unauthorized access to your environments by other AWS clients.

Currently, only IPv4 is supported, as such in our documentation, we had only the respective addresses. We have now added also the IPv6 addresses that we plan to use. The enablement of the IPv6 addresses will happen no earlier than February 2026. Until then, please ensure any needed action is performed, based on the information below.  The Destination service ingress endpoints are the ones that are called by your HTTP client, accessing its REST API (you would not usually need to take action for this flow, unless you have productive calls to the service from your own network) and the Cloud Connector (only in the cases where automatic token retrieval is performed for an on-premise OAuth destination). If you make use of this on-premise token retrieval functionality and if the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does not support IPv6, no action is needed, as the IPv4 addresses are unaffected.   If the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does support IPv6, then the Java virtual machine will usually prefer to use IPv4 instead of IPv6 (usually controlled via the java.net.preferIPv6Addresses system property). If this is the case for your Java virtual machine, again, no action is needed.   Required Action:  If your JVM is configured to prefer IPv6, you need to verify if you have firewall rules in place that limit outgoing traffic from the network. If that is the case, you would have previously allowed the certain IPv4 addresses to enable the Cloud Connector’s communication with BTP. Now, you need to add also the IPv6 addresses to the allowlist.    Note  As of version 2.18.1, the Cloud Connector shows the IPv6 status on the About screen.    The Destination service egress IPs are the ones on behalf of which external resources are accessed either via Check Connection or automatic token retrieval for an Internet destination. In some cases, you might have an allowlist for IPs at the target system. If that is the case, please add the IPv6 addresses of the Destination service to the list.
