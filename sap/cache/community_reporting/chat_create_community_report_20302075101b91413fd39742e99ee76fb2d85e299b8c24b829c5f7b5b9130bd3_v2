The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various technical updates and changes related to SAP services, like Cloud Logging, Kyma Runtime, Pricing Service, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the records, the main components are Cloud Logging, Kyma Runtime, Pricing Service, Variant Configuration, Connectivity, Job Scheduling Service, Joule, Mobile Services, SAP Build, Cloud Application Programming Model, and Cloud Identity Services. These are the main entities involved.\n\nNext, the relationships between these entities. For example, Cloud Logging is connected to OpenTelemetry index changes, which affect Kyma Runtime and other services. Kyma Runtime has updates related to Istio modules and LogParser API deprecation. The Pricing Service and Variant Configuration have new features for tax calculations and tracing. Connectivity and Job Scheduling Service have updates on destinations and resource tags. Joule has new transactional use cases, and Cloud Identity Services have new authorization features.\n\nThe importance rating should be high since these updates are critical for system stability, compliance, and performance. The rating explanation would focus on the impact of these changes on operations and the need for adaptation.\n\nFor the detailed findings, I need to list key insights. Each insight should have a summary and explanation, citing the relevant records. For example, the OpenTelemetry index changes in Cloud Logging affect multiple services, requiring updates in queries. The Istio module updates in Kyma Runtime change default behaviors, needing testing. New tax calculation features in Pricing Service and tracing enhancements in Variant Configuration are important for compliance and performance monitoring.\n\nThe date range should cover from the earliest valid date (2024-03-27) to the latest (2025-10-30). \n\nI need to structure all this into the required JSON format, ensuring proper citations and adherence to the grounding rules.

They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you are using the OpenTelemetry logs/metrics feature and rely on the old index suffix on your custom OpenSearch content / queries. In such cases you need to adapt:  Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.    If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern (e.g. metrics-otel-v1-*) instead of targeting individual indexes.      Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.    \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-10-29\nValid as Of: 2025-10-29\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 18 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: Native sidecars enabled by default with Istio module 1.22\nDescription: With version 1.27, Istio changed the default behavior of attaching Istio sidecar proxy containers, which now run as native sidecars. This approach resolves network connection issues that arise when regular Istio sidecar proxy containers are not ready at the same time as application containers or init containers. Additionally, regular sidecar containers prevent Pods from finishing, for example, in the case of Jobs. If you use the Kubernetes API, an istio-proxy container running as a native sidecar appears in the initContainers list instead of the containers list in a Pod's spec. To learn more, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  To allow more time for Kyma runtime users to adjust to this change, the Istio module in version 1.21 disables the default use of native sidecars. Although Istio module 1.21 installs Istio updated to version 1.27, by default, Istio sidecar proxies are still deployed as regular sidecar containers. With version 1.22 of the Istio module, Istio proxy sidecars will be deployed by default as native sidecars.   The Istio module 1.22 is scheduled to be rolled out to the fast channel on October 8, 2025, and to the regular channel on October 22, 2025.   To use native sidecars before the Istio module 1.22 is released, you must annotate specific Pods or Pod templates with the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\".  To continue using regular sidecars instead of native sidecars after the Istio module 1.22 is released, choose one of these solutions:  Disable the use of native sidecars for a particular workload by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" on a Pod or in the Pod template.  Disable the feature globally for all workloads by setting the compatibilityMode field in the Istio CR to true. See Compatibility Mode.  Required action: Test how your application and the tooling (such as automations or monitoring) behave when the Istio sidecar proxy runs as a native sidecar by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"true\"\" for all your workloads. This is especially important if you have implemented any workarounds for problems caused by the Istio sidecar proxies' lifecycle or if you use automation or monitoring tools to observe the istio-proxy containers. If everything works fine, you can:  Leave the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\", so that you immediately benefit from native sidecar functionality regardless of the Istio module's upgrades.  Remove the annotation and rely on the default settings.  In case of issues, you can explicitly set the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" to use regular sidecar containers until you fix the problem. This guarantees that nothing will change when native sidecars are enabled by default by the Istio module 1.22.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-09-05\nValid as Of: 2025-10-22\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 19 ---\nComponent: Application for Data Replication and Administration\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Configure External Tax Providers\nDescription: There is a new screen to configure the connection to external tax providers.
