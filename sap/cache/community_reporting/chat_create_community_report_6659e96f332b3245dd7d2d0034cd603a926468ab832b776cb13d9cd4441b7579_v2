In this case, each row was populated with data only up to a certain column and following fields were empty or contained their type-specific initial value. The full content of the first TABLES parameter was always correct.   This program error occurred under special complex preconditions, for which the affected TABLES parameters needed to have a certain layout structure of field types, while the affected table content was being transferred in compressed row-based serialization format.    Note  This was a regression bug which had been introduced with JCo 3.1.9.0        Changed values of property jco.destination.repository_destination, which were returned from the currently active DestinationDataProvider instance for a given destination name, were not processed correctly by the JCo runtime, and already existing JCoDestination instances for that destination name were not updated with the new value.   Such existing JCoDestination instances still returned the old JCoRepository instance, although a different one might be associated with the newly configured repository destination.
