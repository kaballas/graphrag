The overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters will be improved by proper index sizing, especially in high-ingest and huge storage volume scenarios. To achieve this, we will switch from daily indexes to the index rollover approach targeting the updated release date - 17. April 2025.  With this change, the index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., logs-json-2024.11.19), but a six-digit number (e.g., logs-json-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you run queries against the old index suffix. In such cases you need to adapt:      Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.          If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern instead of targeting individual indexes.          Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.      This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-02-10\nValid as Of: 2025-04-17\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1020 ---\nComponent: SAP BTP Cockpit\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Neo\nTitle: Opt-In Control for Force Deletion of Subaccounts in SAP BTP\nDescription: To prevent accidental force deletion of subaccounts containing content, SAP BTP introduces new safeguards:    Global account administrators must now opt in to allow force deletion of subaccounts via a dedicated global account setting. This setting is located under the Subaccounts section in the global account settings and is labeled Enable Subaccounts Force Deletion. For more details on how to access and manage global account settings, see  Managing Global Accounts Using the Cockpit (Cloud Foundry) and  Managing Global Accounts Using the Cockpit (Neo environment).       Force deletion is only allowed for subaccounts not marked as Used for production. If a subaccount is marked as Used for production force deletion is always prohibited, regardless of the global setting. To modify the Used for production status of a subaccount, use the Edit Subaccount action in the Account Explorer See:     Change Subaccount Details for Cloud Foundry      Change Subaccount Details for the Neo environment          These changes apply across the SAP BTP cockpit, btp CLI, and API operations    Note  Any automation or manual operation relying on force deletion will be blocked unless:    The global setting Enable Subaccounts Force Deletion is explicitly enabled by the global account admin      The subaccount is not marked as Used for production.      \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-01\nValid as Of: 2025-04-17\nVersion: Cloud\n\n\",735\n131,\"--- Record 1011 ---\nComponent: Cloud Integration for Data Services\nEnvironment: Neo\nTitle: 4k Agent Communication Certificates\nDescription: 4k agent communication certificates are now generated when a new agent is configured or an existing agent is reconfigured.

Search and summarize subscription contract: This capability enables users to retrieve subscription contract details based on key parameters such as the Sold-to Party, Product, Employee Responsible, Technical Resource, and start and end date range.   Joule enables users to view a summary of the subscription contract by displaying key attributes such as the Status, Price Details, Change History, Total Contract Value, and Important Notifications. The contract summary varies depending on the activation status of the subscription contract ensuring users receive accurate information based on the current state of the contract lifecycle.

The target audience of the change is developers:   Until now, service bindings of the Application Autoscaler always provided url, username, and password in the credentials section. These credentials could be used to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using the “Basic” HTTP Authentication security scheme.  What changes  We are going to remove the support for “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API.   To enable you to prepare and test this transition, we are introducing a new parameter credential-type, which can be used to proactively prepare for the removal.  Note  Alternatively, you have the option to change the behavior up to three months later.   If no credential types are defined in the service binding parameters, the Application Autoscaler service applies a default. This default is for now binding-secret.       When the credential-type binding-secret is chosen, url, username, and password will be provided in the credentials section.       When the credential-type x509 is chosen, url, username and password are not provided in the credentials section.       Regardless of which credential-type is active, it is always possible access to the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using mTLS, see Defining a Custom Metric.  On 2025-01-22, we plan to change the credential-type default to x509, but you will still be able to explicitly specify the credential-type binding-secret.   Starting, 2025-04-30 only the credential-type x509 will be valid, either set explicitly, or by default, if not set explicitly.  Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       Or the credential-type parameter is set to binding-secret during the creation of the binding.      If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type\"\", \"\"x509\"\"]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.   For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.\nAction: Recommended\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-07-25\nValid as Of: 2024-07-25\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2539 ---\nComponent: Cloud Identity Services\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo\nTitle: Regional Availability\nDescription: Cloud Identity Services now operates with two IPs in the data center in China: 121.91.104.198 and 121.91.104.204   The following IPs are no longer in use: 157.133.186.67 and 157.133.186.78.
