Additionally, the planned deletion of v1beta1 for the end of May will also be postponed. A new target date will be announced in the future.  Required action: Migrate all your APIRule custom resources (CRs) to version v2.      To migrate your APIRule CRs from version v2alpha1 to version v2, you must update the version in APIRule CRs’ metadata.  To migrate your APIRule CRs from version v1beta1 to v2, follow the procedure described in the blog posts:   APIRule migration - noAuth and jwt handlers  APIRule migration - Ory Oathkeeper based OAuth2 handlers    For more information, see Changes Introduced in APIRule v2alpha1 and v2.

The new CRD allows you to expose your workloads using one of the three supported access strategies: jwt, noAuth, and extAuth. The noAuth access strategy provides a simple configuration for exposing workloads over the specified HTTP methods. The jwt access strategy allows you to secure your workload by defining Istio JWT configuration and the extAuth access strategy allows for providing custom authentication and authorization logic. For more information, see APIRule Custom Resource.  Additionally, version 3.0.2 contains the following fixes:  We've fixed the behavior of in-cluster connectivity when using JWT handler in APIRule. Now, in-cluster connectivity is blocked.  Now, when you create an APIRule with the noAuth access strategy, it is validated if the target workload has an Istio sidecar proxy injected.  \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-05-05\nValid as Of: 2025-05-05\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 966 ---\nComponent: Data Space Integration\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Assignees Column Available in Company Policies\nDescription: In the list of company policies (Configure  Data Spaces), the column Assignees now shows you how many clients are already assigned to the company policy.
