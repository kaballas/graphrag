The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes several records from SAP-related components, each with details about new features, deprecations, and updates. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the records, the main components are SAP Build Apps, SAP BTP Cloud Foundry Runtime, Cloud Management Tools, Authorization and Trust Management Service, Automation Pilot, Connectivity, Extensions, and Foundational Services. These are the core entities in the community.\n\nNext, the relationships between these entities. For example, the deprecation of weak client certificates in Cloud Foundry Runtime affects security across other components. The new features in Automation Pilot, like Kubernetes Operators and Remote Work Processor, might integrate with other services. The SCIM API updates in Foundational Services relate to user provisioning, which ties into Authorization and Trust Management.\n\nThe summary should highlight the interdependencies and the focus on security and automation. The importance rating would be high (maybe 8.5) because these updates are critical for maintaining security and enabling new functionalities in SAP's ecosystem.\n\nFor detailed findings, I'll list key insights like the security hardening in Cloud Foundry, new automation features, SCIM API enhancements, and the deprecation notice. Each insight needs to reference the relevant records. The date range is from the earliest valid date (2024-01-01) to the latest (2024-01-25). \n\nI need to ensure that each section follows the structure: title, summary, rating, explanation, findings with explanations, and date range.

We are doing so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  While the change has already been rolled out on the regions br10 and eu20 in November 2023, the remaining regions are scheduled to follow on February 22, 2024.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates/mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  Action:  If you are using client certificates/mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command: openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see 3333978 .
