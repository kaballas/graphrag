Task View apps offer reporting based on the task overall status, while Organizational Unit View apps offer reporting based on the task execution status of each organizational unit. Additionally, Organizational Unit View apps allow you to perform reporting based on company code groups, independently of country/region assignments.  Remember  For these new apps, the following new static role templates are available that need to be assigned to users so they can access the new apps:  For the Task View apps: AFC_ReportingTaskView  For the Organizational Unit View apps: AFC_ReportingOrgUnitView    These apps are accompanied by the Manage Company Code Groups app that allows you to create, edit, and delete company code groups to support reporting based on task execution level.
