This happened due to some IDs in the paths of the requests that could not be aggregated at the endpoint level. This issue has been corrected by replacing such IDs with an asterisk. With that, now you see aggregations such as /api/v1/pricing/documents/*/conditions/* or /api/v1/pricing/documents/*/items/* instead of individual requests per document id, item id, or condition id.
