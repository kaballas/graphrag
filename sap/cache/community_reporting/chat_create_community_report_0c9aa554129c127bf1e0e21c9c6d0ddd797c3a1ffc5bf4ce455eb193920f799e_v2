To achieve this we already switched from daily indexes to the index rollover approach (see previous announcement from 17.

October 2025.   With this change OpenTelemetry logs and metrics index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days.
