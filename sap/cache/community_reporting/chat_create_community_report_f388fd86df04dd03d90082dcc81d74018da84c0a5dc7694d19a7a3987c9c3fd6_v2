The target audience of the change is developers:   Until now, service bindings of the Application Autoscaler always provided url, username, and password in the credentials section. These credentials could be used to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using the “Basic” HTTP Authentication security scheme.  What changes  We are going to remove the support for “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API.   To enable you to prepare and test this transition, we are introducing a new parameter credential-type, which can be used to proactively prepare for the removal.  Note  Alternatively, you have the option to change the behavior up to three months later.   If no credential types are defined in the service binding parameters, the Application Autoscaler service applies a default. This default is for now binding-secret.       When the credential-type binding-secret is chosen, url, username, and password will be provided in the credentials section.       When the credential-type x509 is chosen, url, username and password are not provided in the credentials section.       Regardless of which credential-type is active, it is always possible access to the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using mTLS, see Defining a Custom Metric.  On 2025-01-22, we plan to change the credential-type default to x509, but you will still be able to explicitly specify the credential-type binding-secret.   Starting, 2025-04-30 only the credential-type x509 will be valid, either set explicitly, or by default, if not set explicitly.  Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       Or the credential-type parameter is set to binding-secret during the creation of the binding.      If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type\"\", \"\"x509\"\"]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.   For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.\nAction: Recommended\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-07-25\nValid as Of: 2024-07-25\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2539 ---\nComponent: Cloud Identity Services\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo\nTitle: Regional Availability\nDescription: Cloud Identity Services now operates with two IPs in the data center in China: 121.91.104.198 and 121.91.104.204   The following IPs are no longer in use: 157.133.186.67 and 157.133.186.78.

This default will be changed to x509 (instead of binding-secret).   Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type\"\", \"\"x509\"\"]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.   For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.  Until 2025-04-30 you may configure the credential-type to binding-secret, to restore the previous configuration.\nAction: Recommended\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-22\nValid as Of: 2025-01-22\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1578 ---\nComponent: Pricing Service\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Pre-Production -Support X.509 Certificates\nDescription: For getting an oauth token to call an endpoint of the Pricing service it used to be required to specify the client id and the client secret.

New software releases used to be deployed to all customer tenants at the same time. We will continue to do that for our administration UI and our Administration service, but for the configuration and pricing services we will first deploy the 2502 release only to all non-productive tenants (including the partner tenants) on January 22, 2025 and only two weeks later, on February 5, we will also deploy it to the productive tenants.  Action: It is recommended to make yourself familiar with the release dates on our product page. Review the changes in the Pre-Production version of the documentation that will be published on January 22 and use the given two weeks to test the new release in your non-productive tenants and process the actions of the recommended or required changes that are announced here in the release notes.
