Note: There are no urgent upgrade notes for the 1.32 release.  Action: There is one API removal in Kubernetes v1.32. The flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3 API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration has been removed. To prepare for this, you must edit your existing manifests and rewrite client software to use the flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1 API version, available since v1.29. All existing persisted objects are accessible via the new API. Notable changes in flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3 include that the PriorityLevelConfiguration spec.limited.nominalConcurrencyShares field only defaults to 30 when unspecified, and an explicit value of 0 is not changed to 30.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-05-08\nValid as Of: 2025-06-13\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 647 ---\nComponent: SAP Cloud Application Event Hub\nEnvironment: Other\nTitle: SAP Cloud ALM Health Monitoring for SAP S/4HANA Cloud\nDescription: Use SAP Cloud ALM Health Monitoring when working with an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system in a Formation.

As a consequence, deployments of MTAs containing modules of type java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee might start to fail, as the buildpack used by default is SAP Java Buildpack 1.   To ensure compliance with this change, starting from the beginning of July, the MTA deployment will switch the default value for the buildpack parameter from sap_java_buildpack (SAP Java Buildpack 1) to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta (SAP Java Buildpack 2).  Action:  Plan and migrate your applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2 ahead of the scheduled change. In your deployment descriptors, you need to explicitly set one of the parameters buildpack or buildpacks of the java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee modules to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta. Note that this transition involves more than just configuration updates and may require code modifications.
