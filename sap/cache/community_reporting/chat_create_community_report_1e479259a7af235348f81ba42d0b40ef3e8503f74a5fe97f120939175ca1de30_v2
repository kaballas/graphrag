We are doing so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  While the change has already been rolled out on the regions br10 and eu20 in November 2023, the remaining regions are scheduled to follow on February 22, 2024.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates/mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  Action:  If you are using client certificates/mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command: openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see 3333978 .  If your certificate fails the verification, please contact the issuer of the certificate with the command you executed and the output you got and request a certificate that passes the verification.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-25\nValid as Of: 2024-01-25\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3603 ---\nComponent: Cloud Management Tools,SAP BTP Cockpit\nEnvironment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other\nTitle: New Quick Action for Global Account Administrators to Assign Themselves as Subaccount Administrators in the Account Explorer\nDescription: If you're a global account administrator, you can now easily assign yourself as an administrator of any subaccount in your account structure.
