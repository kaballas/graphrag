To achieve this we will switch from daily indexes to the index rollover approach targeting the 2501a release (RTC 06.02.25)   With this change, the index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., logs-json-2024.11.19), but a six-digit number (e.g. logs-json-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  This should not affect most use cases, but if there is strict a dependency on the date suffix in the index name format, this needs to be adapted.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-12-06\nValid as Of: 2024-12-12\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1765 ---\nComponent: Cloud Logging\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: New \"\"Service\"\" Dashboard\nDescription: A new \"\"Service\"\" dashboard offers detailed information about the usage of the service using its dedicated index.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-12-06\nValid as Of: 2024-12-12\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1766 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: API Gateway module: Update to version 2.10.0\nDescription: The new version brings the following improvements:  Now, Kyma dashboard includes a banner informing about the deprecation of v1beta1 APIRule custom resources.
