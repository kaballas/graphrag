The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various technical updates and changes related to SAP services, like Cloud Logging, Kyma Runtime, Pricing Service, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the sources, the main components are Cloud Logging, Kyma Runtime, Pricing Service, Variant Configuration, Connectivity, Job Scheduling Service, Joule, Mobile Services, SAP Build, Cloud Application Programming Model, and Cloud Identity Services. These are the main entities involved.\n\nNext, the relationships between these entities. For example, Cloud Logging is connected to Kyma Runtime and Cloud Foundry through updates on index formats and telemetry. Kyma Runtime has changes related to Istio modules and LogParser API. Pricing Service and Variant Configuration are linked through new features in configuration APIs and tax calculations. Connectivity and Job Scheduling Service have updates on destinations and resource tags. Joule is connected to document grounding and transactional use cases. Mobile Services and SAP Build have updates on supported versions and new features.\n\nNow, the importance rating. Since these are all technical updates affecting various services, the importance is high. The rating should be around 8.5 because they impact multiple areas and require actions from users, but maybe not as critical as security issues.\n\nFor the summary, I need to highlight the main changes and their interconnections. The detailed findings should cover each key area: Cloud Logging changes, Kyma Runtime updates, Pricing and Variant Configuration enhancements, Connectivity and Job Scheduling Service updates, Joule's new features, Mobile Services and SAP Build changes, and Cloud Identity Services improvements. Each finding needs a summary and explanation with data references.\n\nDate range: The earliest date is 2024-01-01 (from Record 3211) and the latest is 2025-10-29 (from Record 156).

They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you are using the OpenTelemetry logs/metrics feature and rely on the old index suffix on your custom OpenSearch content / queries. In such cases you need to adapt:  Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.    If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern (e.g. metrics-otel-v1-*) instead of targeting individual indexes.      Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.    \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-10-29\nValid as Of: 2025-10-29\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 18 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: Native sidecars enabled by default with Istio module 1.22\nDescription: With version 1.27, Istio changed the default behavior of attaching Istio sidecar proxy containers, which now run as native sidecars. This approach resolves network connection issues that arise when regular Istio sidecar proxy containers are not ready at the same time as application containers or init containers. Additionally, regular sidecar containers prevent Pods from finishing, for example, in the case of Jobs. If you use the Kubernetes API, an istio-proxy container running as a native sidecar appears in the initContainers list instead of the containers list in a Pod's spec. To learn more, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  To allow more time for Kyma runtime users to adjust to this change, the Istio module in version 1.21 disables the default use of native sidecars. Although Istio module 1.21 installs Istio updated to version 1.27, by default, Istio sidecar proxies are still deployed as regular sidecar containers. With version 1.22 of the Istio module, Istio proxy sidecars will be deployed by default as native sidecars.   The Istio module 1.22 is scheduled to be rolled out to the fast channel on October 8, 2025, and to the regular channel on October 22, 2025.   To use native sidecars before the Istio module 1.22 is released, you must annotate specific Pods or Pod templates with the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\".  To continue using regular sidecars instead of native sidecars after the Istio module 1.22 is released, choose one of these solutions:  Disable the use of native sidecars for a particular workload by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" on a Pod or in the Pod template.  Disable the feature globally for all workloads by setting the compatibilityMode field in the Istio CR to true. See Compatibility Mode.  Required action: Test how your application and the tooling (such as automations or monitoring) behave when the Istio sidecar proxy runs as a native sidecar by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"true\"\" for all your workloads. This is especially important if you have implemented any workarounds for problems caused by the Istio sidecar proxies' lifecycle or if you use automation or monitoring tools to observe the istio-proxy containers. If everything works fine, you can:  Leave the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\", so that you immediately benefit from native sidecar functionality regardless of the Istio module's upgrades.  Remove the annotation and rely on the default settings.  In case of issues, you can explicitly set the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" to use regular sidecar containers until you fix the problem. This guarantees that nothing will change when native sidecars are enabled by default by the Istio module 1.22.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-09-05\nValid as Of: 2025-10-22\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 19 ---\nComponent: Application for Data Replication and Administration\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Configure External Tax Providers\nDescription: There is a new screen to configure the connection to external tax providers.

This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.    Version 1.19.1 introduces the following improvement:    We've fixed an issue where defining multiple external authorizers in the Istio CR resulted in only the last one being configured in the Istio installation configuration.    Version 1.19.0 introduces the following improvements:      We've updated Istio to version 1.26.1 (#1463). Read the Istio 1.26.1 release announcement and Istio 1.26.0 release announcement.      EnvoyFilters not created by the API Gateway module's RateLimit are now detected. When the module detects such an EnvoyFilter, it sets the Istio custom resource (CR) to the Warning state.    \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-07-22\n\",381\n335,\"--- Record 3211 ---\nComponent: Mobile Services\nEnvironment: Neo\nTitle: Supported versions for Cloud Build Service\nDescription: We've updated the supported versions for the Cloud Build service:    March 2024 (2305 PL16) Mobile Development Kit SDK version, iOS version, and notes      March 2024 (2305 PL14)    Fiori Packaged Kapsel and iOS versions      Custom Fiori Client Kapsel and iOS versions          February 2024 (2305 PL12) SAP Asset Manager SDK version, iOS version, and notes      January 2024 (2305 PL11) Mobile Development Kit SDK version, iOS version, and notes      See Supported Build Types, Client Types, Packaging Details, and Build Options. \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-01\nValid as Of: 2024-03-29\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3212 ---\nComponent: SAP Build\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Promote Feature for Live Process Projects\nDescription: The Promote feature is now available for live process projects.
