Note that: Previously, you can add data point comments when a restricted cross calculation is used in the filter, but the specific filters on dimensions used to define this cross calculation will not be included in the context for comments. Now, they will be included in the context. Comments are not supported for calculated cross calculations or aggregations. Comments sourced from restricted cross calculations will also be shown in the comment widget when the same context applies.    Planning mprovements:   You can now manually migrate a copy of an existing allocation process or step to a data action with the Migrate to Data Action button in the legacy allocations app. The existing allocation process or step won't be affected. You can also migrate an existing allocation step (as part of a data action) created by referencing a legacy allocation step to one that supports detailed configuration in the data action designer.  Note that creating an allocation process or step using the legacy allocations app, as well as an allocation step (as part of a data action) that references a legacy allocation step, is no longer supported. We recommend using the allocation step in data actions to configure your allocation.  The data action designer now allows you to switch between displaying the ID or description of dimension members from the Display section of the toolbar, to help identify the correct members.  In advanced formulas, with the new configuration function of CONFIG.READ_CALCULATED_MEMBER_VALUES, calculated members, which include non-leaf members, account members with formulas, and calculated measures, can now be defined in and read by RESULTLOOKUP and LINK functions. This configuration function is only supported on SAP Analytics Cloud tenants based on SAP HANA Cloud platform. For details, see CONFIG.READ_CALCULATED_MEMBER_VALUES at About Script Formulas and Calculations in Advanced Formulas for Planning.  In advanced formulas, you can now define a virtual variable member for the version dimension in VARIABLEMEMBER.  In the predictive step of multi actions, you can now use Train Only and Apply Only actions to retrain and apply the predictive model separately. These two new actions come especially handy in what-if simulations, where you can apply the predictive model to different versions with distinct future values for the influencers and produce forecasts, without having to retrain the predictive model multiple times.      Calendar improvements:   As owner of SAP Analytics Cloud calendar events or as assignee of a calendar process, you can now enable the access to your calendar events from external applications. A calendar API allows you to interact with the events in the SAP Analytics Cloud calendar. For details, see Access Calendar Events Using the Calendar API.  As the creator of calendar processes or manual calendar tasks, you can now enable all involved parties to view the events in Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams. For details, see Integrate Your Calendar Events in Microsoft Tools.    Modeling improvements:   The modeler has been extensively redesigned to align with the changes made to models in SAP Analytics Cloud. Models are now more flexible, and you can select how you’d like to build your model. When creating a new model in the Modeler, the application lets you decide whether you want to focus on the data first approach followed by building your model structure, or build your model structure first followed by adding your data. At the heart of this redesign is the new model type, whose capabilities have been extended to offer more flexibility to your modeling workflows. While you can still create classic account models and datasets, we encourage you to try out the new model type to benefit from the latest functionalities available. For more information, check out Get Started with Flexible Modeling, or this blog.   The Data Export API has been extended and now support Public Dimensions. This compliments the Data Import Service API – Master Data Public Dimension, recently released in QRC Q3 2023.  Three new formulas are now available: YearToDate (YTD), QuarterToDate (QTD) and MonthToDate (MTD). These formulas will help modeler and planners perform running totals across time granularities for a given year, quarter, or month.  The Calculations workspace in the modeler now offers an Object Dependency Graph, which provides a graphical representation of object relationships.  The Detail() formula is now deprecated. We strongly recommend replacing this formula in your models with an Exception Aggregation using type SUM and Exception Aggregation Dimension using All Members to see the achieve results. For more information, see: KBA 3235670 - Details () Formula in SAP Analytics Cloud Modeler is Deprecated. For more details on the Data Export API improvements, new formulas and the new dependency graph, check out this blog.     Augmented Analytics improvements:   Just Ask, powered by artificial intelligence, is a natural language query interface used to query data.  Acquired data model support: Classic account and new models.  Initial support of live SAP Datasphere.  Supports queries in English.  Supports copying results to a story and opening data analyzer.    Enhanced accuracy:  Just Ask supports LLM learning enhanced learning with each release.  Automatically infers similar words based on meaning.  Supports customizing synonyms for both metadata and master data.    Enhanced relevancy of query results:   Centrally set searchable models.   Reduces ambiguity when different models include the same names.  Captures user intent through preset rules.      Commenting and Scheduling improvements:   Data point commenting is now supported in models that have role-based data security applied via model privacy. You can comment on data points if you have role-based permissions for multiple read and write permissions on more than one dimension.  You can now use the Include Formatting option while scheduling a publication with the CSV file type and keep the numerical formatting precisely as it appears in the table or chart.  The No End Date option is no longer available. We recommend not creating recurrent\",264\n30,\" and Look ahead.  When creating stacked bar/column charts or stacked area charts in the optimized design experience, you can now add both the version (or category) dimension and other dimensions to the color feed.  When adding the Version (or Category) dimension to the Color section for your chart, you can now choose to use the measures/accounts to set the color and patterns. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.  When creating story calculations based on data from the new model (with an account dimension), you can now use MEMBERLOOKUP and ACCOUNTLOOKUP functions in the calculations. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.  When using a restricted measure calculation that includes a Version dimension, you can now remove the version dimension from the chart axis. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.    Planning improvements:  When you use the Add Member functionality, inner dimension members relative to the member where you trigger this functionality are now automatically replicated and filled into the new line. This enhancement is also available to tables built on SAP BPC live data models.  When configuring a version management step in multi actions, you now have the option to decide how you want your data to publish. You can choose to automatically publish your changes and have the publish fail if there are any restrictions, or you can choose to automatically publish your changes and discard any data that is affected by restrictions.  When configuring the API step of multi actions, you can now select the Require CSRF Token checkbox and enter a CSRF token URL if a CSRF token is required by the external application you want to use.  You can now benefit from the features of Multi Actions Service API on the SAP Business Accelerator Hub.  In data actions, you can now select the checkbox Allow \"\"All Members\"\" as a parameter property. Parameters with this property enabled can be used in the source context of different types of data action steps. In data action triggers, you can now choose Member Selection, Input Control, or Story Filter to set values for such parameters using the All Members selection.  In validation rules created by combining dimension members, you can now copy dimension member combinations from other applications like Microsoft Excel or from existing member combinations, and paste them into the validation rule grid, either by using dedicated buttons or via keyboard shortcuts. This helps you quicky add many member combinations into your rule.  In IF statements of advanced formulas, you can now use \"\"==\"\" or \"\"!==\"\" to define a dimension combination filter that produces a scope of dimension member combinations based on whether or not dimension properties match.  When editing a public version with the recommended planning area defined in the model settings, you can now first select the checkbox Auto-generate based on the table context in the Builder panel of the table you're working on before putting the public version into Edit Mode. The recommended planning area that's applied also takes into account the table context that covers story, page, and table filters. This helps you further restrict the size of the recommended planning area to improve performance, especially for large public versions.  The following Story APIs can now be used to customize the planning area:  As an application designer or story developer in optimized story experience, you can use getPlanningAreaInfo with filter related APIs to define customized planning area. You can further use startEditMode and copy API to edit or copy the customized planning area.  As an application designer or story developer in optimized story experience, you can use startEditMode API to start edit mode on specific planning areas in public versions.  In both analytics designer and optimized story experience, the copy API to now supports the options to create a planning version from visible data and customized planning area.      Calendar improvements:  Next to the planned start and end dates of calendar events, you can now see the actual dates of the events in the List workspace and in the Details panel of an event. Both planned and actual dates are visualized in the Gantt chart. Administrators can turn off the display of the actual dates under System > Administration. For details, see Work in the List Workspace.  To better identify overdue and delayed events, you can now filter your calendar List workspace according to their time-related status (On Track, Delayed, or Overdue). For details, see Filter Calendar Events.  You can now view the time zone in which a calendar task series was created by selecting the globe icon in the Time section of a series or single occurrence. If a series takes place during a daylight-saving time change, it is adjusted accordingly and takes place one hour earlier or later. Note that you need to update existing series to make use of this feature.  Until now, you could add parent processes to events. Now you can also add or remove direct child events in the Details panel of a process. For more information, see Work with Processes.  You can now reset the setting changes of decoupled occurrences so they match the series settings again. You can do this either from the Details panel of the decoupled occurrences, from the Details panel of the series, or when you update the series. For more information, see Working With Series in Work with Calendar Events You Created.    Modeling improvements:  A new ToPeriod formula now allows you to aggregate a running total across flexible time granularities for a given period. This dynamic formula will help modelers create calculated measures using Year-to-Date, Quarter-to-Date and Month-to-Date running totals at a model level, and reuse them in stories. ToPeriod can also be used in combination with LOOKUP or RESTRICT.  You can now combine formulas with other formulas in calculated measures. This improvement will save you time, as you’ll no longer have to create multiple calculated measure to combine LOOKUP, RESTRICT, YOY, SMA & CAGR with other formulas.  Performance improvements are possible for currency rates tables containing large volumes of data. This follows the introduction of the Data Import API for currency data\",264\n\n\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}, "key": "chat_create_community_report_94eb14afc7233bacf362e994a3cea1f102efe5ca0551cf3badc1ad86d846fd94_v2"}
