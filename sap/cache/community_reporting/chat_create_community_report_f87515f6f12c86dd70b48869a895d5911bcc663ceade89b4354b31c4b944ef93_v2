Currently, only IPv4 is supported, therefore in our documentation we had listed only the respective addresses. We have now added also the IPv6 addresses that we plan to use. The enablement of the IPv6 addresses will happen no earlier than February 2026. Until then, please ensure any needed action is performed, based on the information below.Note  Regions for which we haven’t added IPv6 address in the documentation are currently not planned for this activity.  The Connectivity service ingress endpoints are the ones that are called by the Cloud Connector. If the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does not support IPv6, no action is needed, as the IPv4 addresses remain unaffected.  If the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does support IPv6, then the Java virtual machine (JVM) will usually prefer using IPv4 instead of IPv6 (usually controlled via the system property java.net.preferIPv6Addresses). If this is the case for your JVM, again, no action is needed.     Note  As of version 2.18.1, the Cloud Connector shows the IPv6 status on the About screen.

If this is the case for your JVM, again, no action is needed.     Note  As of version 2.18.1, the Cloud Connector shows the IPv6 status on the About screen.    Required Action:  If your JVM is configured to prefer IPv6, you need to verify if you have firewall rules in place that limit outgoing traffic from the network. If this is true, you would have previously allowed the Connectivity service’s IPv4 addresses in order to enable the Cloud Connectors communication with BTP.

Currently, only IPv4 is supported, as such in our documentation, we had only the respective addresses. We have now added also the IPv6 addresses that we plan to use. The enablement of the IPv6 addresses will happen no earlier than February 2026. Until then, please ensure any needed action is performed, based on the information below.  The Destination service ingress endpoints are the ones that are called by your HTTP client, accessing its REST API (you would not usually need to take action for this flow, unless you have productive calls to the service from your own network) and the Cloud Connector (only in the cases where automatic token retrieval is performed for an on-premise OAuth destination). If you make use of this on-premise token retrieval functionality and if the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does not support IPv6, no action is needed, as the IPv4 addresses are unaffected.   If the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does support IPv6, then the Java virtual machine will usually prefer to use IPv4 instead of IPv6 (usually controlled via the java.net.preferIPv6Addresses system property). If this is the case for your Java virtual machine, again, no action is needed.   Required Action:  If your JVM is configured to prefer IPv6, you need to verify if you have firewall rules in place that limit outgoing traffic from the network. If that is the case, you would have previously allowed the certain IPv4 addresses to enable the Cloud Connector’s communication with BTP. Now, you need to add also the IPv6 addresses to the allowlist.    Note  As of version 2.18.1, the Cloud Connector shows the IPv6 status on the About screen.    The Destination service egress IPs are the ones on behalf of which external resources are accessed either via Check Connection or automatic token retrieval for an Internet destination. In some cases, you might have an allowlist for IPs at the target system. If that is the case, please add the IPv6 addresses of the Destination service to the list.

A cause exception similar to Caused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: class com.sap.scc.util.LogUtils (in unnamed module @0x2d019f4f) cannot access class sun.security.validator.ValidatorException (in module java.base) can no longer occur, when running the Cloud Connector with SapMachine 11, 17, or 21.  In a shadow instance, the message \"\"LDAP changes will not take effect unless Cloud Connector is restarted\"\" will now be shown only if the LDAP configuration has indeed been changed.  After an upgrade of an instance using both, a separate HA (high availability) port and multiple LDAP instances, the LDAP configuration did not work anymore. The previous configuration got corrupted and as a consequence, the trace was wrongly showing \"\"Unable to determine whether password should be changed for user sccadmin\"\".  Alerts about a successful switch of roles are now no longer popping up again after having deleted these alerts. This was a regression in 2.18.0.  The setting for user OID mapping for client certificate authentication did not survive a restart, it was stored and shown correctly in the UI. However, for the logon always \"\"CN\"\" was used again after a restart.  After an upgrade, an email configuration that used TLS, lost its TLS attribute. This was a regression in 2.18.0.  The upgrade now ignores corrupted zip files (for example, file size 0) in the log directory so the Cloud Connector can be started properly after an upgrade.
