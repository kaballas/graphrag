The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various records from different components like Pricing Service, Variant Configuration, Kyma Runtime, Cloud Logging, etc. Each record has details about updates, changes, and announcements.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the components mentioned, the main ones are Pricing Service, Variant Configuration, Kyma Runtime, Cloud Logging, SAP BTP Cockpit, Java Server, Cloud Identity Services, and SAP Alert Notification Service. These seem to be the core entities in the community.\n\nNext, the relationships between these entities. For example, Pricing Service and Variant Configuration are both under the Technology line of business and have updates related to APIs and tracing. Kyma Runtime and Cloud Logging have changes affecting logging and telemetry. SAP BTP Cockpit introduces new security features, while Java Server updates involve Tomcat versions. Cloud Identity Services had an off-cycle upgrade, and SAP Alert Notification Service added new events.\n\nNow, the summary should highlight the main points: the community is focused on SAP's cloud technologies, with updates across various services, emphasizing stability, security, and compliance. The importance rating would be high because these updates are critical for maintaining system stability and security, which are vital for enterprise operations.\n\nFor the detailed findings, I need to list 5-10 key insights. Each insight should have a summary and explanation. For example, the updates to Pricing Service and Variant Configuration's API tracing, the changes in Cloud Logging's index management, the security enhancements in SAP BTP Cockpit, the Tomcat version upgrades, the deprecation of LogParser API in Kyma Runtime, and the new features in SAP Alert Notification Service.\n\nI also need to ensure that each finding references the relevant records. For instance, the Cloud Logging changes are mentioned in records 1019, 1020, 1764, and 156. The Kyma Runtime's LogParser API deletion is in record 16. The SAP BTP Cockpit's force deletion control is in record 1020.\n\nThe date range should cover the earliest and latest valid dates from the records. The earliest is 2024-01-01 (record 1020) and the latest is 2025-10-29 (record 156). \n\nI need to structure the JSON output correctly, ensuring all sections are present and properly formatted. Also, check that the references are correctly cited with the record IDs and dates. Avoid any markdown and ensure the JSON is valid.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"SAP Cloud Technology Updates and Compliance Measures (2024-2025)\",\n    \"summary\": \"This report outlines key updates and compliance measures across SAP's cloud technology ecosystem, focusing on pricing services, logging systems, identity management, and runtime environments.

We're going to make the following change for security reasons. Redirect URIs without wildcards only match the exact entry.  If you've deployed custom web applications and defined OAuth redirect URIs without wildcards (*), the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service accepts arbitrary subdomains and paths.    Example  The allowed URI https://myhost.com matches also the following specific values:      https://myhost.com/somepath      https://somesubdomain.myhost.com      This isn't allowed anymore. Only https://myhost.com is accepted after the change.    Action  For affected applications, update the redirect URIs in the application security descriptor with the specific URI and/or wildcards. This ensures that they match the specific URIs during user logon after the stricter rules are in effect.

The overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters will be improved by proper index sizing, especially in high-ingest and huge storage volume scenarios. To achieve this, we will switch from daily indexes to the index rollover approach targeting the updated release date - 17. April 2025.  With this change, the index names will have a new format.

Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you run queries against the old index suffix. In such cases you need to adapt:      Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.          If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern instead of targeting individual indexes.          Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.

They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you are using the OpenTelemetry logs/metrics feature and rely on the old index suffix on your custom OpenSearch content / queries. In such cases you need to adapt:  Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.    If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern (e.g. metrics-otel-v1-*) instead of targeting individual indexes.      Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.    \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-10-29\nValid as Of: 2025-10-29\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 18 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: Native sidecars enabled by default with Istio module 1.22\nDescription: With version 1.27, Istio changed the default behavior of attaching Istio sidecar proxy containers, which now run as native sidecars. This approach resolves network connection issues that arise when regular Istio sidecar proxy containers are not ready at the same time as application containers or init containers. Additionally, regular sidecar containers prevent Pods from finishing, for example, in the case of Jobs. If you use the Kubernetes API, an istio-proxy container running as a native sidecar appears in the initContainers list instead of the containers list in a Pod's spec. To learn more, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  To allow more time for Kyma runtime users to adjust to this change, the Istio module in version 1.21 disables the default use of native sidecars. Although Istio module 1.21 installs Istio updated to version 1.27, by default, Istio sidecar proxies are still deployed as regular sidecar containers. With version 1.22 of the Istio module, Istio proxy sidecars will be deployed by default as native sidecars.   The Istio module 1.22 is scheduled to be rolled out to the fast channel on October 8, 2025, and to the regular channel on October 22, 2025.   To use native sidecars before the Istio module 1.22 is released, you must annotate specific Pods or Pod templates with the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\".  To continue using regular sidecars instead of native sidecars after the Istio module 1.22 is released, choose one of these solutions:  Disable the use of native sidecars for a particular workload by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" on a Pod or in the Pod template.  Disable the feature globally for all workloads by setting the compatibilityMode field in the Istio CR to true. See Compatibility Mode.  Required action: Test how your application and the tooling (such as automations or monitoring) behave when the Istio sidecar proxy runs as a native sidecar by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"true\"\" for all your workloads. This is especially important if you have implemented any workarounds for problems caused by the Istio sidecar proxies' lifecycle or if you use automation or monitoring tools to observe the istio-proxy containers. If everything works fine, you can:  Leave the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\", so that you immediately benefit from native sidecar functionality regardless of the Istio module's upgrades.  Remove the annotation and rely on the default settings.  In case of issues, you can explicitly set the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" to use regular sidecar containers until you fix the problem. This guarantees that nothing will change when native sidecars are enabled by default by the Istio module 1.22.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-09-05\nValid as Of: 2025-10-22\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 19 ---\nComponent: Application for Data Replication and Administration\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Configure External Tax Providers\nDescription: There is a new screen to configure the connection to external tax providers.
