Improved visibility of free service plans: When configuring assignments in the Entity Assignments page, the Add Service Plans dialog box now displays the \"\"Always Free\"\" and \"\"Free Tier\"\" labels for service plans falling into these categories. This enhancement allows you to easily identify which plans are not charged for consumption.      Enhanced Service Assignments page: In the Service Assignments page, under the All Services view, we have added a new column called Assigned To. It shows you the total number of directories and subaccounts to which each service plan is assigned in your global account. You can click on the links in this column to quickly navigate to the selected service view and display more details about these assignments.      Access to service-related links: Documentation links, support info links, and SAP Discovery Center links, have been added when available. These links can be accessed in the Add Service Plans dialog box in the Entity Assignments page and in the main table of both Entitlements pages by clicking on the new    (Service Details) icon for any service listed under the Service Technical Name column.      Improved search functionality: In both Entitlements pages, the Search field has been relocated to the top of the page. You can now search for more than one term. Also, when you start typing, you get a list of suggestions. This change makes it more convenient for you to quickly search for specific entitlements or services.

With this enhancement, we've added entitlement source information, which displays how each entitled plan was added to your global account. This addition allows global account admins and viewers to gain a better understanding of the relationship between contractual service entitlements and the technical assets (services and plans) in your global account. This functionality is highly valuable, for example, if your account has multiple subscriptions from different packages for the same service plan, or your global account is entitled to service plans that are derived from both the subscription-based and consumption-based models.  Here's what you can expect:      Entitlements  Service Assignments page: Look for the Show commercial info toggle button. By turning on this option, you will see these new commercially-oriented columns added to the main table: Entitlement Source, Licensed Quantity, and Commercial Type.      Entitlements  Entity Assignments page:    Find the new View Commercial Info tab, which provides comprehensive commercial information.      Add Service Plans toggle button. By turning on this dialog box: Each service plan now includes an expandable Entitlements Sources section. This feature is accessible when configuring your assignments in the Manage Assignments view.          Additionally, we've introduced an Entitlement Source filter in both pages, allowing you to easily list plans based on their source of entitlement.

You can configure the list to allow or block different file types during repository onboarding or adjust them for existing repositories using the Update Repositories API. This update provides greater control, improved security, and flexibility in managing your repositories.
