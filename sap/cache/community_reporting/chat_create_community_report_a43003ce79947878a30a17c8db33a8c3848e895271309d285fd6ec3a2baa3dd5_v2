It observes the state of the NATS cluster and reconciles its state according to the desired state.  NATS is an infrastructure that enables the exchange of data in the form of messages. JetStream is a distributed persistence system providing more functionalities and higher qualities of service on top of ‘Core NATS’. For further information about NATS and NATS JetStream, consult the Official NATS Documentation.  Kyma Eventing can use NATS as backend to process events and send them to subscribers.  NATS is an optional module, which you can activate as required. By default, it will be inactive when you create a new Kyma cluster. For details, see Enable and Disable a Kyma Module.

Only condition values are returned in the target document currency based on the item's target quantity and unit of measure. To help SAP CPQ to cope with condition rates that use alternative units of measure, the item condition details of endpoint GET /api/v1/pricing/documents/{documentId} is enhanced with a new field rateNormalized, which also considers the target currency and the sales unit of measure.  This field is for use in SAP CPQ only and may change becoming incompatible at any time when requested by SAP CPQ. Do not use this field in any other integrations.
