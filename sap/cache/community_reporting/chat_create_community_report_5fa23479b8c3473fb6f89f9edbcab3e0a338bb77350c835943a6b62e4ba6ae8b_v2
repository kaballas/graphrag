The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various records from different components and environments, mostly related to technology and SAP systems. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the records, components like Kyma Runtime, Istio module, Decentralized Identity Verification, Pricing Service, and others are mentioned. Environments include Cloud Foundry, Kyma, Neo. There are also mentions of updates, changes, and new features.\n\nNext, the title should be specific and include representative entities. Maybe something like \"SAP Technology Updates and Enhancements in 2025\" since many records are from 2025.\n\nThe summary needs to highlight the main points: updates to Istio modules, changes in telemetry logs, new features in pricing services, identity verification improvements, etc. Also, note the transition to native sidecars and the impact on users.\n\nFor the importance rating, since these are critical updates affecting multiple systems and requiring user actions, a high rating like 8.5 makes sense. The explanation would focus on the widespread impact and required adjustments.\n\nDetailed findings should list key insights. For example, the Istio module updates, telemetry log changes, pricing service enhancements, identity verification features, and the GraphQL integration.

They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you are using the OpenTelemetry logs/metrics feature and rely on the old index suffix on your custom OpenSearch content / queries. In such cases you need to adapt:  Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.    If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern (e.g. metrics-otel-v1-*) instead of targeting individual indexes.      Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.    \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-10-29\nValid as Of: 2025-10-29\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 18 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: Native sidecars enabled by default with Istio module 1.22\nDescription: With version 1.27, Istio changed the default behavior of attaching Istio sidecar proxy containers, which now run as native sidecars. This approach resolves network connection issues that arise when regular Istio sidecar proxy containers are not ready at the same time as application containers or init containers. Additionally, regular sidecar containers prevent Pods from finishing, for example, in the case of Jobs. If you use the Kubernetes API, an istio-proxy container running as a native sidecar appears in the initContainers list instead of the containers list in a Pod's spec. To learn more, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  To allow more time for Kyma runtime users to adjust to this change, the Istio module in version 1.21 disables the default use of native sidecars. Although Istio module 1.21 installs Istio updated to version 1.27, by default, Istio sidecar proxies are still deployed as regular sidecar containers. With version 1.22 of the Istio module, Istio proxy sidecars will be deployed by default as native sidecars.   The Istio module 1.22 is scheduled to be rolled out to the fast channel on October 8, 2025, and to the regular channel on October 22, 2025.   To use native sidecars before the Istio module 1.22 is released, you must annotate specific Pods or Pod templates with the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\".  To continue using regular sidecars instead of native sidecars after the Istio module 1.22 is released, choose one of these solutions:  Disable the use of native sidecars for a particular workload by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" on a Pod or in the Pod template.  Disable the feature globally for all workloads by setting the compatibilityMode field in the Istio CR to true. See Compatibility Mode.  Required action: Test how your application and the tooling (such as automations or monitoring) behave when the Istio sidecar proxy runs as a native sidecar by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"true\"\" for all your workloads. This is especially important if you have implemented any workarounds for problems caused by the Istio sidecar proxies' lifecycle or if you use automation or monitoring tools to observe the istio-proxy containers. If everything works fine, you can:  Leave the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"\"true\"\", so that you immediately benefit from native sidecar functionality regardless of the Istio module's upgrades.  Remove the annotation and rely on the default settings.  In case of issues, you can explicitly set the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"\"false\"\" to use regular sidecar containers until you fix the problem. This guarantees that nothing will change when native sidecars are enabled by default by the Istio module 1.22.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-09-05\nValid as Of: 2025-10-22\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 19 ---\nComponent: Application for Data Replication and Administration\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Configure External Tax Providers\nDescription: There is a new screen to configure the connection to external tax providers.

This increases the stability and reliability of the reconciliation for the Istio module's operator. See issue #155.  We've updated the Istio version to 1.23.2. Read the Istio 1.23.2 release announcement and Istio 1.23.0 Change Notes. Take note of the following breaking changes included in the new minor version of Istio:  Deferred cluster creation: In the context of Envoy, a cluster is a group of logically similar upstream hosts that Envoy connects to. Typically, clusters are defined and created at startup. This means that regardless of whether or not a cluster will be used during the lifetime of the Envoy process, it will still be initialized. Envoy has introduced a new optimization that allows these clusters to be created on the worker threads inline during requests, which can save memory and CPU cycles. If you rely on the old behavior, consider using the compatibility mode, which disables the deferred cluster creation feature by setting ENABLE_DEFERRED_CLUSTER_CREATION to false.  Updates to Envoy cluster metrics parsing: Previously, the Envoy cluster metrics for services that did not use the .svc.cluster.local suffix were incorrectly truncated and parsed. This was because Envoy cluster metrics use dots . as a delimiter between metric namespaces. It is impossible to properly distinguish between those delimiters and the dots in hostnames or cluster names. To address this, the regex for parsing cluster_name has been updated to look for a semicolon that indicates the end of a cluster's name. If you have any dependency on the full stat name for cluster metrics, you must update your monitoring system to account for this change. If you require more time to make adjustments, consider using the compatibility mode, which reverts this behavior by setting ENABLE_DELIMITED_STATS_TAG_REGEX to false.  \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-10-10\nValid as Of: 2024-10-23\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2063 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: Telemetry module: Update to version 1.25.0\nDescription: The new version brings the following improvements:      Logs, Metrics, and Traces: You can list all resources across the pipeline types LogPipeline/TracePipeline/MetricPipeline using kubectl get kyma-telemetry-pipelines (#1487).

To learn about new features, bug fixes, and changes in this release, read the Istio 1.27 release announcement and Upgrade Notes.Caution  Since version 1.27, Istio injects the Istio proxy as an init container by default. In this release, the Istio module's operator disables this behavior to maintain compatibility. Disabling this behavior is a temporary measure and will be removed with Istio module 1.22. After this, sidecar proxies will be injected as init containers by default. For more information, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  The Istio module now supports installation with Istio images injected into the installer from environment variables. This allows for more flexible deployments, especially in environments where images are not available in a public registry. See issue #1519.  Additionally, this release contains the following bug fixes:  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.  We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled. See issue #1523.  We've fixed a bug where the app.kubernetes.io/version label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources. See issue #1523.  We've fixed a bug where Istio sidecar injected as initContainer was not removed during Istio uninstallation.

In addition to the default Istio containers, the module also restarts native sidecar init containers. However, configuring native sidecars directly from the Istio Custom Resource (CR) is not supported. For more information, see issue #1426.Caution  If your cluster's Istio service mesh includes workloads with initContainer sidecars, the Istio module will restart these workloads for the first time. See Restart of Workloads with Enabled Istio Sidecar Injection, Istio sidecar documentation, and Kubernetes Native Sidecars in Istio.    We've updated the Istio version to 1.26.2. For more information, read the Istio 1.26.2 release announcement and Istio 1.26.0 release announcement.  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.  We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled.  We've fixed a bug where the app.kubernetes.io/version label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources.  \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-07-22\nValid as Of: 2025-08-11\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 328 ---\nComponent: SAP Document AI\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Integration of SAP Document AI (Embedded Edition) with SAP Mobile Start\nDescription: You can now integrate SAP Document AI with SAP Mobile Start.
