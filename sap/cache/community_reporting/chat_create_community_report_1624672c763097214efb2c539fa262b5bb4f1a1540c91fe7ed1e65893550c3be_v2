Client versions up until 2.49.0 propose the old server URL (https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/), which will continue to work. If you pass the new URL in an old client, you will be asked to add it as a trusted URL at first usage. Client version 2.54.0 and higher will propose the new URL (https://cli.btp.cloud.sap/), but will still also accept the old one.  For the time being, both URLs work, but we recommend to eventually update your scripts to start using the new server URL.

Read Istio Controller Overview for more details.  To ensure consistency between the Istio trace settings, the Telemetry module's trace feature, and OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions, we have improved the service.name value, which is attached to every span emitted by the Istio proxy. To determine the service name, the Istio module now follows the same conventions as the Telemetry module. First, it tries to leverage the kubernetes.io/name label. If not available, it checks for the app label. If neither label is present, it falls back to using the Deployment's name. Additionally, the namespace suffix is not attached anymore to the service name, which aligns with the conventions of OpenTelemetry.  We have also changed the Istio tracer from the deprecated OpenCensus tracer to OpenTelemetry. This update has resulted in an improvement to the Istio span name, which is now prefixed with the operation name. For example, a name like example.com is changed to ingress example.com. To learn more, see Switch Istio Tracing to OTLP and Align Istio Service Name.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-02-15\nValid as Of: 2024-02-20\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3406 ---\nComponent: Peppol Exchange\nEnvironment: Neo\nTitle: Enhancement to the service\nDescription: In the test environment, the schematron file of the EN16931 rules for CII and UBL syntaxes has been already updated to version 1.3.11.
