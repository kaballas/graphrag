The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes various records from SAP Analytics Cloud and other components, each with their own updates, deprecations, and improvements.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the records, the main components are SAP Analytics Cloud, ABAP Environment, Process Visibility Capability, Authorization and Trust Management Service, and others like Java Server and Cloud Logging. These components are part of the SAP ecosystem, so the community is likely around SAP's technology and tools.\n\nNext, the relationships. The records mention updates to features, deprecations, and new functionalities. For example, SAP Analytics Cloud has several updates in Q1 2024, Q2 2024, and Q4 2023. There's also a mention of deprecated components like Java Web Tomcat 8 and the /check_token endpoint. These relationships show how different parts of the SAP system are evolving and interacting.\n\nThe importance rating should reflect the significance of these updates. Since there are multiple new features and deprecations affecting various components, the rating is probably high. Maybe around 8.5, considering the impact on users needing to adapt to changes and adopt new tools.\n\nFor the detailed findings, I need to list key insights. The first could be the enhancements in SAP Analytics Cloud, covering features like data commenting, scheduling improvements, and new visualization options. Then, the deprecation of older technologies like Java Web Tomcat 8 and the /check_token endpoint. Also, the introduction of new models and the changes in process visibility with execution limits. Each of these points needs to be supported by the relevant records.\n\nThe date range should cover from the earliest valid date mentioned, which is 2023-11-10, to the latest, 2024-05-17. That gives a range of [2023-11-10, 2024-05-17].\n\nI need to ensure that each finding is backed by the correct data references, using the record IDs provided. Also, the summary should encapsulate the main points about the community's structure and the significance of the changes. The title should be specific, maybe \"SAP Technology Updates and Deprecations (2023-2024)\" to capture the time frame and the nature of the changes.\n\nFinally, check that the JSON structure is correct, with proper sections and no markdown. Make sure the explanations are grounded in the data provided and that the importance rating is justified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"SAP Technology Updates and Deprecations (2023-2024)\",\n    \"summary\": \"This report outlines key updates, deprecations, and enhancements across SAP's technology ecosystem from late 2023 to mid-2024.

You can now use the Include Formatting option while scheduling a publication with the CSV file type and keep the numerical formatting precisely as it appears in the table or chart.  The No End Date option is no longer available. We recommend not creating recurrent schedules with this option. For all existing recurring scheduled publications that are created with the No End Date option, it is recommended to update the series with a definite number of recurrences or an end date to continue uninterrupted scheduled publication under the End Recurrence By option. Schedules with No End Date recurrences will start having their occurrences canceled after a year.  As a Schedule Owner, you now get notified via email whenever the status of your scheduled publication changes from open to partially successful, failed, or canceled. You can view details of the status by clicking the Open Task button on the notification email.

Enhanced member exclusion paradigm: The new member selector introduces an advanced paradigm for member exclusion: it allows you to deselect one or more descendants of a selected node. For example, select the country “USA” but explicitly exclude the state “Florida”. This selection is dynamic, which means that if, in the data source, a new state is registered under the country “USA”, it is implicitly part of the selection.    In the optimized story experience, we now support model replacement.  Replacement within stories is done on a per model basis and will be limited to models that have the same data source type and same number and type of structure dimensions. The original model and replacement model do not need to share the same connection nor have the same number of objects (accounts, measures, dimensions, or properties). However, the version level of the system where the replacement model is located is meant to be the same or higher than that of the system on which the original model is located.  Some data models cannot be used as replacement models because their feature set is superseded by alternative models for which further new features are being developed. These types of models can only be used as original models and can be replaced by their designated alternative models. For example:  An SAP Datasphere Analytic Dataset can be replaced by an SAP Datasphere Analytic Model.  A Classic Model (Account Only) can be replaced by a New Model with accounts and measures.  A Public Dataset can be replaced by a New Model with measures (and no accounts).    In the optimized story experience, the displayed numeric values (and decimal places) will be based on the full precision (non-rounded) source value: this improves the precision of planning workflows that use these numbers. However, some numbers may not be displayed as expected and will require additional formatting.  As an application integration developer, you can call the SAP Analytics Cloud REST API by story ID and widget ID to access data from numeric points in optimized story experience. You can therefore consume the SAP Analytics Cloud widgets in SAP Mobile Start.   The following features are now supported in optimized story experience: section widget, batch export, export all table data to XLSX.  In optimized story experience, you can use composites on responsive pages in addition to canvas pages. In addition, you can replace models of a composite, or objects in use without replacing the model after adding it to your story.  As a story designer in optimized story experience, you can open the font scaling tool to set font scale for responsive pages or individual widgets for specific devices, so that the font sizes in your story are dynamically adapted to different devices.      Planning improvements:  In the advanced formulas of data actions, you can now use analytic models owned by SAP Analytics Cloud as source models.   When checking data changes in the analytic window during data action tracing, you can now enable Show Only Leaves for a dimension to only show its leaf members.  New Planning Trigger Styling Options: When using the optimized story experience, you can now set and save your default style preferences for your planning triggers in the Theme Preferences dialog. Additionally, you have the option to upload SVG files to use as the trigger button icon either in the Styling panel or the Theme Preferences dialog.  Prediction Interval in Multi Actions: In the predictive step of multi actions, when you choose either the Train and Forecast or Apply predictive action, you can now save a prediction interval by choosing a prediction interval minimum and a prediction interval maximum. Using this feature allows you to visualize the prediction quality.    Data Analyzer improvements:  In data analyzer you can now filter in the filterline on calculated measures you’ve created. After having created the calculated measures, they appear instantly in the list of measure options in the filterline.  As a user of the Calculated Measures dialog in data analyzer you can now find syntax highlighting in the formula editor. This adds clarity to the formula you create by differentiating objects like measures and functions, etc.  The Available Objects list and the Builder panel in data analyzer have been enhanced:  In the Available Objects list the sorting now works separately for either dimensions, measures or structures via the More (three dots) menu for the respective object type.   If your model contains a hierarchy, the hierarchy structure is now displayed in the Available Objects list and in the Builder panel.    If you export data as PDF file in data analyzer, you can now use the setting option Fit to page width which allows you to resize your table to fit the actual page width for the PDF export.  In data analyzer you can now open a model from SAP BW workspaces, save insights to workspaces and reopen them from a workspace. You can also open data analyzer from a chart or table in story that uses a model saved to a workspace.    Calendar improvements:  In both optimized story experience and analytics designer, you can use script APIs to create a calendar process, send an immediate reminder, update or reopen a calendar event, get more properties of it, and so on.   Administrators can now configure which in-app notifications or emails are sent to users who are involved in calendar events. They can define the settings depending on the users’ roles (owners, assignees/reviewers, or viewers). For details, see Emails and Notifications.

ToPeriod can also be used in combination with LOOKUP or RESTRICT.  You can now combine formulas with other formulas in calculated measures. This improvement will save you time, as you’ll no longer have to create multiple calculated measure to combine LOOKUP, RESTRICT, YOY, SMA & CAGR with other formulas.  Performance improvements are possible for currency rates tables containing large volumes of data. This follows the introduction of the Data Import API for currency data in QRC3. These include improved loading times, saving times, and improved filtering handling for large currency rates tables.  As a preview for what’s coming next in the Modeling and upcoming enhancements, check out this blog.    Data Analyzer improvements:  You can now find the following improvements for the chart usage in data analyzer:  You can now also use the Stacked Column and the Stacked Bar charts for the visualization of your data.  You can now use the chart visualization with all model types except the classic account model.  There are user experience improvements in the builder panel for charts.    In the table visualization in data analyzer you can now scroll horizontally if the table has a large number of columns. If there are more than 100 columns a warning message is displayed to use the filter function and restrict the number of columns.  In data analyzer you can now drag objects from the builder panel on the table.

The /check_token endpoint is deprecated with immediate effect. Note that the endpoint is mostly used for online token validation. It isn't relevant for offline token validation using the security libraries.  This change conforms with the endpoint deprecation in Cloud Foundry User Account and Authentication (UAA).  Action  Instead of using the /check_token endpoint, we recommend the adaption of the /introspect endpoint.  For more information, see https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/77.1.0/index.html#check-token and https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/77.1.0/index.html#introspect-token.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-05-16\nValid as Of: 2024-05-16\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2930 ---\nComponent: Authorization and Trust Management Service\nEnvironment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Other\nTitle: Deprecation of Service Plans\nDescription: The target audience of the change are developers and subaccount administrators.

On the SAP Analytics Cloud product page, you’ll find a complete set of SAP Analytics Cloud guides and resources.   Some highlights include:  Stories improvements:   As a story designer using the optimized story experience, you now have the option to define which of the following filter types you would like to pass through an internal (page or story) hyperlink: story, page, local, or linked analysis filters.  For bar/column charts and horizontal waterfall charts created in the optimized design experience, you can now choose to show a variance as a waterfall chart.  In the optimized experience, you can now configure the variable settings to preserve the current variable selections (current behavior) when a story is opened or to use the server-defined default values.  For tables in the optimized story experience, you can now sort on version dimension members.  In the optimized story experience, you can now add geo map filters as dynamic text.  Exporting a Story to PowerPoint is now supported in optimized view mode. In addition, as a story developer in story experience, you can use the Export to PowerPoint technical object with script APIs to customize the export experience.  When using the Export dialog to export an optimized story as a PDF, you can now have the export process run in the background by setting the option Enable Export in the Background. However, the option will be disabled for classic stories that have enabled Optimized View Mode.  As a story designer in optimized story experience, you can now customize the view time toolbar for phone and tablet, in addition to desktop. Related interactive tutorial is available: Interactive Tutorial: Customizing View Time Toolbar in Optimized Story Experience.  As a story designer in optimized story experience, you can add geo map filters as a dynamic text.  Exporting Story to PowerPoint is now supported in optimized view mode. In addition, as a story developer in optimized story experience, you can use the Export to PowerPoint technical object with script APIs to customize the export experience.  Custom widgets can now be bookmarked in optimized story experience. As a custom widget developer, you can enable bookmark support for your custom widget in its JSON file.  As a story developer in optimized story experience, you can use a Text Pool technical object with related APIs to translate the texts in the scripts.  As a story developer in optimized story experience, you can use setSelectedMembersWithUnbooked and getActiveSelectedMembersWithUnbooked APIs to set and get selected members on the input control, including unbooked ones.  The Lite Viewer is now available for SAP Analytics Cloud users. This feature is an extension of the Optimized (Unified) Experience that loads the lightest version of the application. To view a story using the Light Viewer:  The story must be part of Optimized (Unified) Experience.  The story should be limited to only core Business Intelligence (BI) functionality- it should exclude Planning and Advanced BI including Scripting, CSS, and so on.  The story must be opened via a URL in Embed mode; it cannot be opened in the View or Present modes.  When a story does not meet these requirements, you will be automatically re-directed to the full Optimized (Unified) Experience view. This Lite Viewer initial release includes upgrades for geographical visualizations to ArcGIS 4.X to benefit from:  Improved rendering performance: map graphics are now rendered using WebGL resulting in a more rapid display of both small and large datasets, including smooth transitions when the map is zoomed or panned.  Improved datapoint interaction: when hovering over datapoints, they are now highlighted to improve interaction. Also, overlapping datapoints are now detected to provide a quicker understanding of the data context.    You can now use the fluid data entry mode in tables built on SAP BPC live data models.  In stories, you can now add data point comments to tables when dimension properties are used in table axes or filters. Similarly, you can also add comments in comment widgets when dimension properties are used in comment widget filters.  In a table of a story built on a new model type (but without an account dimension), you can now add data point comments when Measure Values (the default cross calculation) or restricted cross calculations are in the table axes or filters. Note that: Previously, you can add data point comments when a restricted cross calculation is used in the filter, but the specific filters on dimensions used to define this cross calculation will not be included in the context for comments. Now, they will be included in the context. Comments are not supported for calculated cross calculations or aggregations.
