The user wants a comprehensive report based on the provided data. First, I need to parse the given sources and identify the key entities and their relationships. The main component here is the ABAP Environment, with various updates and features related to ABAP Development Tools, CDS entities, SQL services, and Fiori Launchpad. \n\nLooking at the records, there are multiple entries under ABAP Environment, each describing new features or updates. For example, Record 1401 talks about IDE Action framework, Record 1403 about ATC checks, and Record 1406 introduces CDS table entities. These seem to be part of a larger set of updates in ABAP Environment versions 2502 and 2405.\n\nNext, I need to structure the report according to the specified sections. The title should reflect the key entities, so maybe \"ABAP Environment Enhancements and New Features in 2024-2025\". The summary should highlight the main points: new tools, CDS improvements, SQL services, and Fiori changes.\n\nFor the importance rating, since these are all new features and updates in a technology environment, they are likely important. Maybe a 9.0, as they impact development processes and system capabilities.\n\nThe detailed findings need to be 5-10 key insights. Each insight should have a summary and explanation, citing the relevant records. For example, the IDE Action framework (Record 1401), CDS table entities (1406), SQL-based remote access (2923), and the Fiori favIcon change (2921) are all significant. Also, the ATC check updates (1403) and CDS writeable views (1407) are important for developers.\n\nI need to ensure that each explanation includes the data references properly, using the record IDs. Also, the date range should cover from the earliest valid date (2024-03-21) to the latest (2025-02-14). \n\nI should check that all the findings are grounded in the provided data and that the references are correctly cited. Avoid making up any information not present in the sources. Finally, format the JSON correctly without any syntax errors, ensuring that the date range is in the correct format and the explanations are concise but comprehensive.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"ABAP Environment Enhancements and New Features in 2024-2025\",\n    \"summary\": \"This report outlines key updates and features introduced in the ABAP Environment between 2024 and 2025, focusing on ABAP Development Tools, CDS entities, SQL services, and Fiori Launchpad improvements.

On the SAP Analytics Cloud product page, you’ll find a complete set of SAP Analytics Cloud guides and resources.  Some highlights include:   Stories improvements:  In the optimized story experience, the filter by member dialog has been redesigned and now provides new features:  Improved UI architecture: The UI layout of the member selector provides direct access to the essential actions and settings, such as the search field and the hierarchy selection. Other settings, like read mode or text presentation, have been moved into a settings panel that can be opened on demand. The multi-column presentation of the selectable members allows for better readability.  Increased flexibility: The dialog box can now be resized, and can be dragged to a different position. The panels are also resizable, and the content of the panels are fully responsive.   Continuous scrolling: The new member selector implements a lazy loading mechanism that applies to the list of selectable members as well as the list of member selections: as you scroll down, members are automatically and continuously loaded at the bottom.  Search hits highlighting: The new member selector bolds each part of a member label that matches the search criteria.  Enhanced search capabilities: The new member selector supports the wildcard search, specifically the wildcard character “*” which replaces zero or more characters.  Enhanced member exclusion paradigm: The new member selector introduces an advanced paradigm for member exclusion: it allows you to deselect one or more descendants of a selected node. For example, select the country “USA” but explicitly exclude the state “Florida”. This selection is dynamic, which means that if, in the data source, a new state is registered under the country “USA”, it is implicitly part of the selection.
