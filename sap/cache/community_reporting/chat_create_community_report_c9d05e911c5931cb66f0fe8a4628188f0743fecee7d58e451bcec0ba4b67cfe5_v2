The user wants a comprehensive report based on the provided contexts. First, I need to parse the given contexts to identify the key entities and their relationships. \n\nLooking at Context 0, it's about ABAP Environment and Fiori-Based Multi-Dimensional Reporting. The main entities here are ABAP Environment, Fiori-Based Reporting, and the new embedded analytics capabilities. The key point is that they allow creating analytical applications without additional code.\n\nContext 1 discusses new reporting apps for task lists, specifically Financial Close Overview and Closing Task Completion apps. The Manage Company Code Groups app is mentioned, which allows creating groups for reporting. The date here is 2024-06-07 to 2024-06-23. The importance is that these apps are recommended for use, replacing deprecated ones.\n\nContext 2 talks about \"Just Ask,\" a natural language query interface. It supports various data models and has enhanced accuracy and relevancy features. The date here is 2025-08-15, but the context mentions live SAP Datasphere support, which might be a recent addition.\n\nContext 3 is about new static role templates for the reporting apps, ensuring users can access them. It also notes that the new apps only show data from post-release task lists, with previous data in deprecated apps. The date here is 2024-06-07 to 2024-06-23.\n\nNow, the user's goal is to create a report on a community of these entities. The title should be specific, maybe something like \"SAP Analytics and Reporting Innovations in 2024-2025.\" The summary needs to tie together the key points: ABAP Environment, new reporting apps, Just Ask, and role templates.\n\nFor the importance rating, considering the multiple updates and their impact on user experience and data handling, a high rating like 8.5 makes sense. The rating explanation would highlight the integration of advanced analytics and user-friendly features.\n\nDetailed findings should include each context's main points. For example, the Fiori-based reporting in ABAP, the new task list apps with role templates, Just Ask's natural language capabilities, and the calendar improvements. Each finding needs a summary and explanation with data references.\n\nThe date range should cover from the earliest context (2024-06-07) to the latest (2025-08-15). I need to ensure all data references are correctly cited with the context IDs and dates. Also, check that the JSON structure is correct, with proper escaping and formatting.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"SAP Analytics and Reporting Innovations in 2024-2025\",\n    \"summary\": \"This report outlines key advancements in SAP's analytics and reporting ecosystem, focusing on ABAP Environment enhancements, new task list reporting apps, natural language querying via 'Just Ask,' and role-based access controls.

When creating stacked bar/column charts or stacked area charts in the optimized design experience, you can now add both the version (or category) dimension and other dimensions to the color feed.  When adding the Version (or Category) dimension to the Color section for your chart, you can now choose to use the measures/accounts to set the color and patterns. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.  When creating story calculations based on data from the new model (with an account dimension), you can now use MEMBERLOOKUP and ACCOUNTLOOKUP functions in the calculations. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.  When using a restricted measure calculation that includes a Version dimension, you can now remove the version dimension from the chart axis. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.    Planning improvements:  When you use the Add Member functionality, inner dimension members relative to the member where you trigger this functionality are now automatically replicated and filled into the new line. This enhancement is also available to tables built on SAP BPC live data models.  When configuring a version management step in multi actions, you now have the option to decide how you want your data to publish. You can choose to automatically publish your changes and have the publish fail if there are any restrictions, or you can choose to automatically publish your changes and discard any data that is affected by restrictions.  When configuring the API step of multi actions, you can now select the Require CSRF Token checkbox and enter a CSRF token URL if a CSRF token is required by the external application you want to use.  You can now benefit from the features of Multi Actions Service API on the SAP Business Accelerator Hub.  In data actions, you can now select the checkbox Allow \"\"All Members\"\" as a parameter property. Parameters with this property enabled can be used in the source context of different types of data action steps. In data action triggers, you can now choose Member Selection, Input Control, or Story Filter to set values for such parameters using the All Members selection.  In validation rules created by combining dimension members, you can now copy dimension member combinations from other applications like Microsoft Excel or from existing member combinations, and paste them into the validation rule grid, either by using dedicated buttons or via keyboard shortcuts. This helps you quicky add many member combinations into your rule.  In IF statements of advanced formulas, you can now use \"\"==\"\" or \"\"!==\"\" to define a dimension combination filter that produces a scope of dimension member combinations based on whether or not dimension properties match.  When editing a public version with the recommended planning area defined in the model settings, you can now first select the checkbox Auto-generate based on the table context in the Builder panel of the table you're working on before putting the public version into Edit Mode. The recommended planning area that's applied also takes into account the table context that covers story, page, and table filters. This helps you further restrict the size of the recommended planning area to improve performance, especially for large public versions.  The following Story APIs can now be used to customize the planning area:  As an application designer or story developer in optimized story experience, you can use getPlanningAreaInfo with filter related APIs to define customized planning area. You can further use startEditMode and copy API to edit or copy the customized planning area.  As an application designer or story developer in optimized story experience, you can use startEditMode API to start edit mode on specific planning areas in public versions.  In both analytics designer and optimized story experience, the copy API to now supports the options to create a planning version from visible data and customized planning area.      Calendar improvements:  Next to the planned start and end dates of calendar events, you can now see the actual dates of the events in the List workspace and in the Details panel of an event. Both planned and actual dates are visualized in the Gantt chart. Administrators can turn off the display of the actual dates under System > Administration. For details, see Work in the List Workspace.  To better identify overdue and delayed events, you can now filter your calendar List workspace according to their time-related status (On Track, Delayed, or Overdue). For details, see Filter Calendar Events.  You can now view the time zone in which a calendar task series was created by selecting the globe icon in the Time section of a series or single occurrence. If a series takes place during a daylight-saving time change, it is adjusted accordingly and takes place one hour earlier or later. Note that you need to update existing series to make use of this feature.  Until now, you could add parent processes to events. Now you can also add or remove direct child events in the Details panel of a process. For more information, see Work with Processes.  You can now reset the setting changes of decoupled occurrences so they match the series settings again. You can do this either from the Details panel of the decoupled occurrences, from the Details panel of the series, or when you update the series. For more information, see Working With Series in Work with Calendar Events You Created.    Modeling improvements:  A new ToPeriod formula now allows you to aggregate a running total across flexible time granularities for a given period. This dynamic formula will help modelers create calculated measures using Year-to-Date, Quarter-to-Date and Month-to-Date running totals at a model level, and reuse them in stories. ToPeriod can also be used in combination with LOOKUP or RESTRICT.  You can now combine formulas with other formulas in calculated measures. This improvement will save you time, as you’ll no longer have to create multiple calculated measure to combine LOOKUP, RESTRICT, YOY, SMA & CAGR with other formulas.  Performance improvements are possible for currency rates tables containing large volumes of data. This follows the introduction of the Data Import API for currency data\",659\n69,\" character “*” which replaces zero or more characters.  Enhanced member exclusion paradigm: The new member selector introduces an advanced paradigm for member exclusion: it allows you to deselect one or more descendants of a selected node. For example, select the country “USA” but explicitly exclude the state “Florida”. This selection is dynamic, which means that if, in the data source, a new state is registered under the country “USA”, it is implicitly part of the selection.    In the optimized story experience, we now support model replacement.  Replacement within stories is done on a per model basis and will be limited to models that have the same data source type and same number and type of structure dimensions. The original model and replacement model do not need to share the same connection nor have the same number of objects (accounts, measures, dimensions, or properties). However, the version level of the system where the replacement model is located is meant to be the same or higher than that of the system on which the original model is located.  Some data models cannot be used as replacement models because their feature set is superseded by alternative models for which further new features are being developed. These types of models can only be used as original models and can be replaced by their designated alternative models. For example:  An SAP Datasphere Analytic Dataset can be replaced by an SAP Datasphere Analytic Model.  A Classic Model (Account Only) can be replaced by a New Model with accounts and measures.  A Public Dataset can be replaced by a New Model with measures (and no accounts).    In the optimized story experience, the displayed numeric values (and decimal places) will be based on the full precision (non-rounded) source value: this improves the precision of planning workflows that use these numbers. However, some numbers may not be displayed as expected and will require additional formatting.  As an application integration developer, you can call the SAP Analytics Cloud REST API by story ID and widget ID to access data from numeric points in optimized story experience. You can therefore consume the SAP Analytics Cloud widgets in SAP Mobile Start.   The following features are now supported in optimized story experience: section widget, batch export, export all table data to XLSX.  In optimized story experience, you can use composites on responsive pages in addition to canvas pages. In addition, you can replace models of a composite, or objects in use without replacing the model after adding it to your story.  As a story designer in optimized story experience, you can open the font scaling tool to set font scale for responsive pages or individual widgets for specific devices, so that the font sizes in your story are dynamically adapted to different devices.      Planning improvements:  In the advanced formulas of data actions, you can now use analytic models owned by SAP Analytics Cloud as source models.   When checking data changes in the analytic window during data action tracing, you can now enable Show Only Leaves for a dimension to only show its leaf members.  New Planning Trigger Styling Options: When using the optimized story experience, you can now set and save your default style preferences for your planning triggers in the Theme Preferences dialog. Additionally, you have the option to upload SVG files to use as the trigger button icon either in the Styling panel or the Theme Preferences dialog.  Prediction Interval in Multi Actions: In the predictive step of multi actions, when you choose either the Train and Forecast or Apply predictive action, you can now save a prediction interval by choosing a prediction interval minimum and a prediction interval maximum. Using this feature allows you to visualize the prediction quality.    Data Analyzer improvements:  In data analyzer you can now filter in the filterline on calculated measures you’ve created. After having created the calculated measures, they appear instantly in the list of measure options in the filterline.  As a user of the Calculated Measures dialog in data analyzer you can now find syntax highlighting in the formula editor. This adds clarity to the formula you create by differentiating objects like measures and functions, etc.  The Available Objects list and the Builder panel in data analyzer have been enhanced:  In the Available Objects list the sorting now works separately for either dimensions, measures or structures via the More (three dots) menu for the respective object type.   If your model contains a hierarchy, the hierarchy structure is now displayed in the Available Objects list and in the Builder panel.    If you export data as PDF file in data analyzer, you can now use the setting option Fit to page width which allows you to resize your table to fit the actual page width for the PDF export.  In data analyzer you can now open a model from SAP BW workspaces, save insights to workspaces and reopen them from a workspace. You can also open data analyzer from a chart or table in story that uses a model saved to a workspace.    Calendar improvements:  In both optimized story experience and analytics designer, you can use script APIs to create a calendar process, send an immediate reminder, update or reopen a calendar event, get more properties of it, and so on.   Administrators can now configure which in-app notifications or emails are sent to users who are involved in calendar events. They can define the settings depending on the users’ roles (owners, assignees/reviewers, or viewers). For details, see Emails and Notifications.
