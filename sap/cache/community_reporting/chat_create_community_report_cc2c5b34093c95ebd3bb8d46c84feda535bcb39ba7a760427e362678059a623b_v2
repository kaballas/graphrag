Action: If the UI of the consuming application allows it, it is recommended to always read the configuration results during interactive configuration without the possible values of characteristics. This can be achieved by using the parameter $select omitting the parameter value possibleValue when creating or reading a configuration. Only when the user clicks on a UI element, like a dropdown list box, that requires to render the possible values on the UI, the possible values should be read for that characteristic using the new endpoint.
