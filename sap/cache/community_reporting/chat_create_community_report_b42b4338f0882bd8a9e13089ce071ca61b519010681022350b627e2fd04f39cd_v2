The user wants a comprehensive report on a community based on the provided data. The data includes several records about SAP components and their updates, deprecations, and new features. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities. Looking at the sources, the main components mentioned are SAP Java Buildpack, Kyma Runtime, Object Store, Peppol Exchange, SAP Digital Payments Add-On, and SAP Document AI. These are the core entities in the community.\n\nNext, the relationships between these entities. The SAP Java Buildpack is being deprecated, which affects applications using it. The Kyma Runtime and Object Store have new features. Peppol Exchange has updates for Finland, and SAP Document AI has improved models. There's also a mention of Cloud Transport Management and Feature Flags Service. These components are interconnected through their environments (Cloud Foundry, Kyma) and the updates they receive.\n\nFor the summary, I should highlight the deprecation of SAP Java Buildpack 1 and the migration to version 2, along with other updates across different components. The importance rating would be high because the deprecation affects many applications and requires urgent action, which is a critical issue for users.\n\nIn the detailed findings, each key insight should cover a major update or change. For example, the deprecation of SAP Java Buildpack 1, the new features in Kyma Runtime, the Peppol Exchange updates in Finland, improvements in SAP Document AI, and the expansion of Cloud Transport Management to new regions. Each of these points needs to be explained with references to the relevant records.\n\nI need to ensure that the date range covers all the valid dates mentioned in the sources. The earliest valid date is 2024-01-01, and the latest is 2025-04-03. \n\nAlso, I have to follow the grounding rules, citing the relevant records for each point. For example, the deprecation of SAP Java Buildpack 1 is mentioned in records 2368 and 1111. The Peppol Exchange updates are in records 2362 and 2361. \n\nI should check that each finding is supported by the data and that the references are correctly formatted. The report needs to be concise but comprehensive, within the 2000-word limit.

Background and Motivation:  SAP Java Buildpack 2 is generally available (GA) since early March 2024 and provides support for the latest and greatest versions of Java (17 and 21) and Tomcat (10.1). We also plan to support TomEE 10 as soon as it goes GA.  SAP Java Buildpack 1, on the other hand, supports older versions of Java (8, 11), Tomcat 9, and an SAP-patched version of TomEE 7 (which reached EoL in March 2021). SapMachine 11 will also reach EoL soon – in December 2024.  Our goal is to focus our efforts on delivering highly-requested new features, reducing technical debt, and boosting product quality and security.  As a result, SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and technical support for it will be provided until June 30, 2025.   Action:    If you have applications running on sap_java_buildpack, you need to migrate them to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta as soon as possible.   Note  If your applications depend on TomEE 7, don’t start the migration yet but wait until we announce the availability of TomEE 10 in SJB 2.  Migration:      If your applications are compiled with Java 8, they should run successfully on any later version as Java versions are backward compatible. The only exception would be if your apps are using internal or undocumented Java APIs that have been removed or changed. Otherwise, your applications should be running fine and no extra effort from your side is required. Still, we recommend that you thoroughly test your application scenarios with the new Java version (17 or 21).    If your application or its dependencies are using former Java EE javax.* packages, you need to migrate them to Jakarta EE jakarta.* ones. You can do that by using any of the community tools available to run the migration. For example:      https://github.com/apache/tomcat-jakartaee-migration      https://tomee.apache.org/javax-to-jakarta.html          If you have multi-target applications (MTA), you need to adjust all modules with the following types:      java      java.tomcat      java.tomee      Since MTA deployment descriptors currently use sap_java_buildpack as a default buildpack, you need to set the buildpack module parameter to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta. For example:  modules:   - name: myapp       type: java.tomcat       parameters:           buildpack: sap_java_buildpack_jakarta  For more information, see MTA Module Types and Module-Specific Parameters.      Timeline:  We plan to support SAP Java Buildpack 1 until June 30, 2025 when it will be removed from SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. Applications that haven’t been migrated to SAP Java Buildpack 2 by then might continue to run but will get an error when being restaged or redeployed.  In Q4 of 2024, we'll stop adding new features to SAP Java Buildpack 1, and will only provide security updates and bug fixes.   In H1 of 2025, new releases for SAP Java Buildpack 1 will be made only for critical security updates and bug fixes.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-08-16\nValid as Of: 2024-08-22\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2369 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: API Gateway module: Update to version 2.5.0\nDescription: This release includes the following changes:      We’ve added support for request modifiers in the v2alpha1 APIRule custom resource (CR).
