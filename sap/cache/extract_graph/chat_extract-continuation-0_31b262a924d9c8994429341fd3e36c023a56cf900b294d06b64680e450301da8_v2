The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. They want me to go through the provided data again and make sure I only emit entities that match the allowed types: organization, person, geo, event. Also, I need to follow the same format as before.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the text again. The first record is about the CF CLI Plugin needing an update. The main event here is the update requirement, which was already captured as an EVENT. No other entities here except maybe the plugin name, but since it's a product, and TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, I shouldn't emit it as an entity. So that's covered.\n\nNext, the Application Autoscaler record. The event was already extracted about ending support for Basic HTTP Auth. The description mentions \"Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API\" but that's a service, not an organization. The credential types like x509 and binding-secret are technical terms, not entities. So no new entities here.\n\nThen, the Cloud Identity Services record. The event was already captured, and the organization \"CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES\" was emitted. The GEO \"CHINA\" was also added. The relationships between the event and the organization and geo were included. But maybe there's more? The IPs mentioned are 121.91.104.198 and 121.91.104.204. Are those considered GEOs? No, because they're IP addresses, not real-world locations. The retired IPs are 157.133.186.67 and 157.133.186.78, but again, those are IPs, not GEOs. So no new entities there.\n\nThe Java Web Tomcat 9 update was captured as an EVENT. The component is \"Java Server\" in the Neo environment. But \"Java Server\" isn't an organization. The environment \"Neo\" is part of SAP, but the user didn't mention emitting environments as organizations unless explicitly named. So no new entities here.\n\nWait, looking back at the original contexts provided, there's mention of \"Cloud Foundry\" and \"SAP Document AI\" in the contexts. But in the real data provided, the user's input doesn't mention those. The real data here is about CF CLI Plugin, Application Autoscaler, Cloud Identity Services, and Java Server. So maybe the previous extraction missed some entities from the contexts, but the user is referring to the current real data.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. Remember to ONLY emit entities that match any of the previously extracted types.\" So maybe in the previous extraction, some entities were missed. Let me check the previous output again.\n\nIn the previous output, the user had:\n\n- CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES as ORGANIZATION\n- CHINA as GEO\n- The events related to those.\n\nBut looking at the Cloud Identity Services record, the description mentions \"Cloud Identity Services now operates with two IPs in the data center in China\". The data center in China is a location, but the GEO is already \"CHINA\". The IPs themselves are not GEOs. So maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, the user's example D had Microsoft Azure as an ORGANIZATION and Sydney, Australia as GEO. So in the current data, the Cloud Identity Services is an ORGANIZATION, and China is the GEO. That's correct.\n\nLooking at the Application Autoscaler event, the description mentions \"Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API\" but that's a service, not an organization. So no entity there.\n\nThe CF CLI Plugin record: the plugin is a product, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, it's not emitted as an entity. The event was captured as \"CF CLI PLUGIN UPDATE REQUIRED — 2024-07-25\".\n\nThe Java Web Tomcat 9 update: the event was captured, and the component is \"Java Server\" in Neo environment. But \"Java Server\" isn't an organization. The environment \"Neo\" is part of SAP, but unless explicitly named as an organization, it's not emitted. So no new entities there.\n\nWait, the user's previous output didn't include any other entities. Maybe the user is referring to the contexts provided earlier, but the current task is about the real data given. The user might have thought that some entities from the contexts were missed, but the real data here doesn't include those contexts. The real data is separate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the current real data and the previous extraction missed some entities. Let me check again.\n\nIn the real data, the first record is about the CF CLI Plugin. The event was captured. The second record is about Application Autoscaler, event captured. Third is Cloud Identity Services, event and organization and geo captured. Fourth is Java Web Tomcat 9, event captured. So maybe the user is expecting more entities, but according to the rules, only the ones that fit the types are allowed. The other parts are technical details not fitting the entity types.\n\nSo perhaps the user is mistaken, but according to the instructions, I need to make sure I only emit the allowed entities. The previous extraction seems to have captured all possible entities. Unless there's something I missed.\n\nWait, in the Application Autoscaler record, the description mentions \"Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API\" but that's a service, not an organization. The \"Application Autoscaler\" itself is a service, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, it's not emitted as an entity. So no.\n\nIn the Cloud Identity Services record, the IPs are not GEOs. The data center in China is a location, but the GEO is \"CHINA\", which was already captured.\n\nThe Java Web Tomcat 9 update: the component is \"Java Server\" in the Neo environment. \"Neo\" is an environment, but unless it's an organization, it's not emitted. The user's example A had \"SAP BTP Neo\" as part of the event, but \"Neo\" alone isn't an organization. So no.\n\nTherefore, the previous extraction seems correct. The user might have thought there were more entities, but according to the rules, only the ones captured are valid. So the answer is that no additional entities or relationships are to be added, as the previous extraction was correct.\n</think>\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923181, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1335, "prompt_tokens": 3829, "total_tokens": 5164, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.27522181659938, "duration": 41.363}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

The target audience of the change is developers:   Until now, service bindings of the Application Autoscaler always provided url, username, and password in the credentials section. These credentials could be used to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using the “Basic” HTTP Authentication security scheme.  What changes  We are going to remove the support for “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API.   To enable you to prepare and test this transition, we are introducing a new parameter credential-type, which can be used to proactively prepare for the removal.  Note  Alternatively, you have the option to change the behavior up to three months later.   If no credential types are defined in the service binding parameters, the Application Autoscaler service applies a default. This default is for now binding-secret.       When the credential-type binding-secret is chosen, url, username, and password will be provided in the credentials section.       When the credential-type x509 is chosen, url, username and password are not provided in the credentials section.       Regardless of which credential-type is active, it is always possible access to the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using mTLS, see Defining a Custom Metric.  On 2025-01-22, we plan to change the credential-type default to x509, but you will still be able to explicitly specify the credential-type binding-secret.   Starting, 2025-04-30 only the credential-type x509 will be valid, either set explicitly, or by default, if not set explicitly.  Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       Or the credential-type parameter is set to binding-secret during the creation of the binding.      If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type\", \"x509\"]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.   For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.\nAction: Recommended\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-07-25\nValid as Of: 2024-07-25\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2539 ---\nComponent: Cloud Identity Services\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo\nTitle: Regional Availability\nDescription: Cloud Identity Services now operates with two IPs in the data center in China: 121.91.104.198 and 121.91.104.204   The following IPs are no longer in use: 157.133.186.67 and 157.133.186.78.

The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to parse each record and identify events, organizations, geos, and people.\n\nStarting with the first record about the CF CLI Plugin. The main point is that the plugin needs an update. The action is required, and the valid date is 2024-07-25. Since this is an announcement, I should create an EVENT entity. The name would be \"CF CLI PLUGIN UPDATE REQUIRED — 2024-07-25\" with a description mentioning the need to update the plugin and the GitHub link. No organizations or geos here, so no relationships.\n\nNext, the Application Autoscaler record. The main event is the end of support for Basic HTTP Auth. The event name would be \"END OF SUPPORT FOR BASIC HTTP AUTH IN APPLICATION AUTOSCALER — 2025-04-30\" since that's the date when only x509 will be valid. The description should note the removal of basic auth and the transition to x509. There's a mention of mTLS and Defining a Custom Metric, but those might not be entities. The action is recommended, but the event is the main thing. No organizations or geos here either, so no relationships.\n\nThird record: Cloud Identity Services in China. The IPs are changing. The event is \"CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES REGIONAL AVAILABILITY UPDATE — 2024-07-25\". The description mentions the new IPs and the old ones being retired. The geos here are CHINA, and the organization is CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES. So, relationships would link the event to China (geo) and the organization. The IPs are part of the description but not entities as they're not real places or organizations.\n\nFourth record: Java Server Tomcat update. The event is \"TOMCAT VERSION UPDATE FOR JAVA WEB TOMCAT 9 — 2024-07-25\". The description includes the version update and security fixes. No organizations or geos here, so no relationships.\n\nNow, checking entity types. For the Cloud Identity Services record, the organization is CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES. The geo is CHINA. The event is the regional availability update. Relationships would be between the event and the organization (involves) and the event and the geo (occurs in). The strength for the organization relationship might be 8, and for the geo, 9.\n\nOther records don't have organizations or geos, so only events. Need to make sure all entity names are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. Relationships are only if there's a clear link, like event involving an organization or occurring in a location.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CF CLI PLUGIN UPDATE REQUIRED — 2024-07-25<|>EVENT<|>Update required for CF CLI Plugin; see GitHub for details)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>END OF SUPPORT FOR BASIC HTTP AUTH IN APPLICATION AUTOSCALER — 2025-04-30<|>EVENT<|>Basic HTTP Auth removed for Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API; transition to x509 credential-type required)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES REGIONAL AVAILABILITY UPDATE — 2024-07-25<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services now uses IPs 121.91.104.198/204 in China; 157.133.186.67/78 retired)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TOMCAT VERSION UPDATE FOR JAVA WEB TOMCAT 9 — 2024-07-25<|>EVENT<|>Java Web Tomcat 9 updated to 9.0.90 with security fixes; update applications to latest runtime)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud identity management service operating in China data centers)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>Region where Cloud Identity Services updated IP addresses for data center operations)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES REGIONAL AVAILABILITY UPDATE — 2024-07-25<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES REGIONAL AVAILABILITY UPDATE — 2024-07-25<|>CHINA<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
