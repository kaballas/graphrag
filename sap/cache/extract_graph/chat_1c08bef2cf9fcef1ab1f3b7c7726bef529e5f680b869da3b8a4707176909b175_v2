The user provided a text about an update to the SAP Java Buildpack in Cloud Foundry. The task is to extract entities and relationships based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, I need to check the entity types allowed: organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"SAP Java Buildpack\" and \"Cloud Foundry.\" But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities. However, the user's example D shows that when TECHNOLOGY is part of the entity types, it's allowed. Wait, the entity_types here are organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"Cloud Foundry\" which is an environment, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we shouldn't emit it as an entity. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" So, since the entity_types don't include TECHNOLOGY, we can't emit \"Cloud Foundry\" as an organization. But \"SAP Java Buildpack\" is a product, so that's also not allowed. So, the only possible entity here is the EVENT.\n\nThe title is \"Version 1.105.0\" and the date is 2024-10-17. The description talks about updates to components. So the EVENT entity would be \"SAP JAVA BUILDPACK VERSION UPGRADE — 2024-10-17\" with a description about the version update and components changed. \n\nNo other entities like organizations or geos are mentioned. So no relationships to emit. The output should be the EVENT entity only.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP JAVA BUILDPACK VERSION UPGRADE — 2024-10-17<|>EVENT<|>SAP Java Buildpack 1 updated from 1.104.0 to 1.105.0 with component version changes including Apache Tomcat 9, SAP HANA Driver, and otel-agent libraries)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925239, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 471, "prompt_tokens": 2960, "total_tokens": 3431, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 33.05495122464734, "duration": 14.249}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
