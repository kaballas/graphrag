The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records based on the given guidelines. First, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events or other entities.\n\nStarting with Record 3686: The title is \"Use of Comments for Feedback\" and the description mentions adding comments to SAP Help Portal documentation. Since this is a new feature, it's an EVENT. The entity name would be \"USE OF COMMENTS FOR FEEDBACK — 2024-01-04\" with the description about adding feedback comments. No organizations or geos here, so no relationships.\n\nRecord 3687: \"Import Teams\" from SAP S/4HANA Cloud to the app. This is a new feature, so EVENT. The entity name is \"IMPORT TEAMS — 2024-01-04\". The description mentions importing teams from SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Here, SAP S/4HANA Cloud is an organization, so a relationship between the event and the organization.\n\nRecord 3688: Kyma Runtime update to version 1.1.0. This is a new feature, so EVENT. The entity name is \"SAP BTP OPERATOR MODULE UPDATE — 2024-01-03\". The description mentions SAP BTP service operator, which is an organization. So, a relationship between the event and SAP BTP.\n\nRecord 3689: New content packages added to the Store. This is a new feature, so EVENT. The entity name is \"NEW CONTENT PACKAGES ADDED TO STORE — 2024-01-01\". The description mentions SAP Build Process Automation, which is an organization. So, a relationship between the event and that organization.\n\nRecord 3690: SAP Conversational AI Community Edition deprecation. This is an event (deprecated). The entity name is \"SAP CONVERSATIONAL AI COMMUNITY EDITION DEPRECATION — 2023-12-31\". The description mentions migration to enterprise edition, which is an organization. So, a relationship between the event and SAP Conversational AI Enterprise Edition.\n\nNow, checking for valid entities. All events are correctly named with dates. Organizations like SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP BTP, SAP Build Process Automation, and SAP Conversational AI Enterprise Edition are valid. No persons or geos mentioned. Relationships are between events and the respective organizations. Each relationship has a description and strength. Need to ensure all entity types are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. Also, check that no products are emitted as entities unless they are organizations. Looks good. Now format the output as per the examples.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>USE OF COMMENTS FOR FEEDBACK — 2024-01-04<|>EVENT<|>Add comments to SAP Help Portal documentation for SAP Business Technology Platform and SAP BTP Neo Environment>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMPORT TEAMS — 2024-01-04<|>EVENT<|>Import teams from SAP S/4HANA Cloud to Manage Teams and Responsibilities app>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP S/4HANA CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Enterprise resource planning system providing team data for import>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMPORT TEAMS — 2024-01-04<|>SAP S/4HANA CLOUD<|>Event imports teams from this organization's system<|>8)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP OPERATOR MODULE UPDATE — 2024-01-03<|>EVENT<|>Update SAP BTP service operator resources to version 0.5.6 with custom Secret feature>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing service operator resources for Kyma Runtime>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP BTP OPERATOR MODULE UPDATE — 2024-01-03<|>SAP BTP<|>Event updates resources on this organization's platform<|>9)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CONTENT PACKAGES ADDED TO STORE — 2024-01-01<|>EVENT<|>Add 19 content packages (12 business, 7 learning) to SAP Build Process Automation Store>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platform offering content packages for business and learning scenarios>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW CONTENT PACKAGES ADDED TO STORE — 2024-01-01<|>SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION<|>Event adds content packages to this organization's Store<|>9)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP CONVERSATIONAL AI COMMUNITY EDITION DEPRECATION — 2023-12-31<|>EVENT<|>Community edition ends December 31, 2023; migrate to enterprise edition>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP CONVERSATIONAL AI ENTERPRISE EDITION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platform for licensed users to migrate bots from community edition>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP CONVERSATIONAL AI COMMUNITY EDITION DEPRECATION — 2023-12-31<|>SAP CONVERSATIONAL AI ENTERPRISE EDITION<|>Event requires migration to this organization's platform<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926893, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1196, "prompt_tokens": 3667, "total_tokens": 4863, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.31471724622409, "duration": 37.011}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
