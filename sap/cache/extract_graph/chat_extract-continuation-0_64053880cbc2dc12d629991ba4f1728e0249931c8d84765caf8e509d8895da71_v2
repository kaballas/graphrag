The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. They want me to make sure I only emit entities that match the allowed types: organization, person, geo, event. Let me look at the provided text again.\n\nThe text is about a change in SAP Ariba Applications' default transformations. The key points are the enhancement with preserveArrayWithSingleElement set to true and the exclusion of the plant attribute from certain transformations. \n\nFirst, I need to check for any entities. The main entity here is the event related to the changes in transformations. The title mentions \"SAP Ariba Applications - default transformations changes,\" which should be an EVENT. The date is 2025-03-25. The description mentions the specific changes, so the event name should be something like \"DEFAULT TRANSFORMATIONS CHANGES FOR SAP ARIBA APPLICATIONS — 2025-03-25.\" The description would include the details about the preserveArrayWithSingleElement and the plant attribute exclusion.\n\nNow, checking for other entities. The text mentions \"SAP Ariba Applications\" as the component, but since the entity types don't include technology, I can't emit that as an organization. The environment is \"Neo,\" but that's part of the environment, not an entity here. There's no mention of a person, geo, or other organizations. So the only entity is the event. \n\nRelationships: The user said to emit relationships only if there's a clear dependency. Since the event is about SAP Ariba Applications, but we can't emit SAP Ariba as an organization (since the entity types don't include technology), there are no relationships to add. \n\nWait, the user's previous examples included relationships when there was an organization involved. But in this case, since SAP Ariba Applications isn't an allowed entity type (unless it's considered an organization, but the user's validation says to drop products/services if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed. The entity_types here are organization, person, geo, event. SAP Ariba Applications is a product, so it's not an organization. So no relationships. \n\nSo the correct output is just the event entity. The previous answer was correct, but maybe the user thought there were more entities. Let me double-check. The text doesn't mention any other entities. So the only entity is the event. No relationships. So the output is as before.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFAULT TRANSFORMATIONS CHANGES FOR SAP ARIBA APPLICATIONS — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Default transformations enhanced with preserveArrayWithSingleElement=true; plant attribute excluded from write/proxy transformations due to API restrictions)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925374, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 575, "prompt_tokens": 2592, "total_tokens": 3167, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.14336781671451, "duration": 18.463}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.

The transformation mappings for the attribute plant are excluded from the default write and proxy write transformations, since the attribute's value cannot be created with POST and PUT or PATCH request anymore.

The user provided a text about changes in SAP Ariba Applications related to default transformations. The task is to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps.\n\nFirst, check the entity types allowed: organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"SAP Ariba Applications\" and \"Neo\" environment. But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, products/services shouldn't be emitted as entities. However, the user's example D included \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as an organization. Wait, in the current text, \"SAP Ariba Applications\" is a product, but the entity types don't include technology. So, per the steps, products shouldn't be entities unless they're part of an event. \n\nLooking at the description, the main change is about default transformations being enhanced. This seems like an EVENT. The title mentions \"SAP Ariba Applications - default transformations changes\" and the valid as of date is 2025-03-25. So the event name would be \"DEFAULT TRANSFORMATIONS CHANGES FOR SAP ARIBA APPLICATIONS — 2025-03-25\". The description should mention the changes made, like the preserveArrayWithSingleElement setting and exclusion of plant attribute transformations.\n\nNext, check for organizations. The text mentions \"SAP Ariba Applications\" but since it's a product and not an organization, it shouldn't be emitted. The environment is \"Neo\", but that's part of SAP's environment, not an organization. So no organizations here.\n\nGEO isn't mentioned, so no geo entities. No named individuals, so no person entities. \n\nFor relationships, since there's only an event and no other entities, there's nothing to link. The output should just have the event entity. Let me make sure the event name is correctly formatted and the description is under 25 words. The description in the example C had multiple points, so I'll condense it here.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFAULT TRANSFORMATIONS CHANGES FOR SAP ARIBA APPLICATIONS — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Default transformations enhanced with preserveArrayWithSingleElement=true; plant attribute excluded from write/proxy transformations due to API restrictions)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
