Remove the following IP ranges from allowlisting between October 20, 2025 and October 24, 2025 if your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules. This is necessary because these IP ranges will be released from SAP and returned to AWS for redistribution, which changes their availability. Removing these ranges helps prevent unauthorized access to your environments by other AWS clients.

It is resolved to the domain of the current region. (See the Domain column in Regions and API Endpoints Available for the Cloud Foundry Environment). When a region has multiple CF API endpoints, the parameter will point to the domain of the respective endpoint used for the deployment. The parameter is different from the existing parameters default-domain and region-primary-domain:      The parameter default-domain usually depends on the current organization setup and the existing shared domains for it. It is not reliable for regions without shared domains, for example regions China (Shanghai) and China (North 3). On the other hand, the region-domain parameter is more sustainable and does not depend on the current organization setup.
