The user provided a text about a new data center for the Cloud Integration Automation Service in China (CN20). The task is to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps.\n\nFirst, check the entity types allowed: organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"China (CN20)\" which is a geographic location, so that's a GEO entity. The event here is the availability of the service in the new data center. The event name should follow the pattern: SHORT TITLE — ISO DATE. The valid as of date is 2024-04-11, so the event name would be \"CLOUD INTEGRATION AUTOMATION SERVICE AVAILABILITY IN CHINA (CN20) — 2024-04-11\".\n\nNext, the description needs to be under 25 words. The original description says \"You can now subscribe to Cloud Integration Automation service in the new data center - China (CN20).\" So the description would be \"Cloud Integration Automation Service now available in China (CN20) data center.\"\n\nFor relationships, the event (new data center availability) occurs in the geographic location China (CN20). So the relationship is between the event entity and the GEO entity. The strength is around 9 since it's a direct location association.\n\nNo organizations are mentioned explicitly, so no ORGANIZATION entities here. The component and environment are part of the technology, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't an allowed entity type, they aren't emitted. Only the event and geo are extracted. Relationships are only between the event and the geo.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD INTEGRATION AUTOMATION SERVICE AVAILABILITY IN CHINA (CN20) — 2024-04-11<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Integration Automation Service now available in China (CN20) data center)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA (CN20)<|>GEO<|>Data center location for Cloud Integration Automation Service)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD INTEGRATION AUTOMATION SERVICE AVAILABILITY IN CHINA (CN20) — 2024-04-11<|>CHINA (CN20)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926756, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 503, "prompt_tokens": 2774, "total_tokens": 3277, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.82134497374581, "duration": 15.807}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
