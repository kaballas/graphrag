The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The instructions say that whenever there's a release, upgrade, fix, etc., we should create an EVENT entity. The name should be a short title followed by the date from \"Valid as Of\" or \"Latest Revision\". \n\nLooking at Record 4011: The title is \"New btp CLI server URL\". The valid as of date is 2023-10-23. So the event name would be \"NEW BTP CLI SERVER URL — 2023-10-23\". The description mentions the new URL and the changes in client versions. I need to make sure the description is under 25 words. Truncate if necessary.\n\nRecord 4012: Title is \"Process Visibility - Configure Processes\". Valid as of 2023-10-23. Event name: \"PROCESS VISIBILITY - CONFIGURE PROCESSES — 2023-10-23\". Description should mention adding SAP Business Workflow as a participant.\n\nRecord 4013: Title \"Search Functionality\" with a fix. Event name: \"SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY FIX — 2023-10-23\". Description about issues being fixed.\n\nRecord 4014: Improved model for invoice documents. Event name: \"IMPROVED INVOICE DOCUMENT EXTRACTION MODEL — 2023-10-23\". Description mentions better date field extraction.\n\nRecord 4015: Similar to 4014 but for paymentAdvice. Event name: \"IMPROVED PAYMENTADVICE DOCUMENT EXTRACTION MODEL — 2023-10-23\". Description includes date and amount fields.\n\nRecord 4016: Edit Template feature. Event name: \"EDIT TEMPLATE FUNCTIONALITY — 2023-10-23\". Description about editing templates and schemas.\n\nRecord 4017: Field Label in Schema Configuration. Event name: \"FIELD LABEL IN SCHEMA CONFIGURATION — 2023-10-23\". Description about user-friendly labels.\n\nRecord 4018: AS2 Receiver Adapter change. Event name: \"AS2 RECEIVER ADAPTER TIMESTAMP OPTION — 2023-10-23\". Description about appending milliseconds.\n\nRecord 4019: Custom Search Attributes. Event name: \"CUSTOM SEARCH ATTRIBUTES FOR B2B — 2023-10-23\". Description about creating custom attributes.\n\nNow, check for organizations. The environments mention Cloud Foundry, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, we don't emit products as entities. However, the user's entity types include organization, so maybe Cloud Foundry is considered an organization? Wait, the instructions say that ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned. Cloud Foundry is a platform, but maybe it's considered an organization here. However, looking at the examples, in Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So Cloud Foundry might be an organization. But in the given records, the environments are listed as Cloud Foundry, but the components are things like SAP BTP CLI, SAP Document AI, etc. So perhaps Cloud Foundry is the environment, but the user's entity types include organization, so maybe Cloud Foundry is an organization. However, the user's examples don't have Cloud Foundry as an organization. Let me check the examples again. In Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So if Cloud Foundry is a service provider, maybe it's an organization. But the user's instruction says to emit ORGANIZATION only if explicitly mentioned. The records mention \"Environment: Cloud Foundry\", but the component is SAP BTP CLI, etc. So maybe Cloud Foundry is the environment, but the user's entity types include organization, so perhaps Cloud Foundry is considered an organization here. However, the user's examples don't have Cloud Foundry as an organization. Alternatively, maybe the user's entity types don't include Cloud Foundry as an organization. Wait, the user's entity types are ORGANIZATION, PERSON, GEO, EVENT. The records mention \"Cloud Foundry\" as an environment, but the user's instruction says that if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products/services. But in this case, the user's entity types include ORGANIZATION, so maybe Cloud Foundry is considered an organization. However, the user's examples don't have Cloud Foundry as an organization. For example, in Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So perhaps Cloud Foundry is an organization here. But I need to check if the user's instruction allows that. The instruction says ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned. So if Cloud Foundry is mentioned as an environment, maybe it's considered an organization. However, the user's examples don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the user's instruction is that products/services/environments are not emitted as entities unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" But in this case, the entity types include ORGANIZATION, so if TECHNOLOGY is allowed, but the user's entity types include ORGANIZATION, then maybe Cloud Foundry is considered an organization. However, the user's examples don't have Cloud Foundry as an organization. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the user's examples again. In Example D, the output includes Microsoft Azure as an organization. So if Cloud Foundry is a service provider, then it's an organization. But the user's instruction says to emit ORGANIZATION only if explicitly mentioned. The records mention \"Environment: Cloud Foundry\", but the component is SAP BTP CLI. So maybe Cloud Foundry is the environment, but the user's entity types include ORGANIZATION, so perhaps Cloud Foundry is considered an organization here. However, the user's examples don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the user's instruction is that products/services/environments are not emitted as entities unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. Since Cloud Foundry is mentioned as an environment, but not as an organization, perhaps it's not emitted. Therefore, in the current records, there are no organizations mentioned except maybe SAP BTP CLI, but that's a product. So perhaps there are no ORGANIZATION entities here. \n\nLooking for GEO entities: The records don't mention any real-world geographies, so no GEO entities.\n\nPERSON entities: None mentioned, so no PERSON.\n\nSo the only entities are the EVENTs from each record. Then, relationships: The instructions say to emit relationships if there's a clear dependency/impact between two entities. For example, if an event involves an organization or occurs in a location. But in this case, the events are about features, fixes, etc., and there's no mention of organizations or locations involved. So no relationships would be emitted. \n\nTherefore, the output should be the list of EVENT entities for each record, with no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW BTP CLI SERVER URL — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>BTP CLI now uses simplified URL https://cli.btp.cloud.sap/; older URLs remain functional temporarily)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS VISIBILITY - CONFIGURE PROCESSES — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>Add SAP Business Workflow as process participant in visibility scenarios)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY FIX — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>Issues in search functionality resolved for SAP Build Work Zone)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IMPROVED INVOICE DOCUMENT EXTRACTION MODEL — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>Enhanced machine learning model for invoice date field extraction accuracy)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IMPROVED PAYMENTADVICE DOCUMENT EXTRACTION MODEL — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>Enhanced model improves date and line item amount extraction for paymentAdvice)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EDIT TEMPLATE FUNCTIONALITY — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>Enable schema changes for templates while preserving existing extraction edits)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FIELD LABEL IN SCHEMA CONFIGURATION — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>User-friendly field labels added for schema configuration in Document AI)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AS2 RECEIVER ADAPTER TIMESTAMP OPTION — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>Option to append milliseconds to message timestamps in AS2 Receiver adapter)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM SEARCH ATTRIBUTES FOR B2B — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>Create custom search attributes for monitoring B2B interchanges)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926190, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1976, "prompt_tokens": 3934, "total_tokens": 5910, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.649284557681504, "duration": 60.522}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Client versions up until 2.49.0 propose the old server URL (https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/), which will continue to work. If you pass the new URL in an old client, you will be asked to add it as a trusted URL at first usage. Client version 2.54.0 and higher will propose the new URL (https://cli.btp.cloud.sap/), but will still also accept the old one.  For the time being, both URLs work, but we recommend to eventually update your scripts to start using the new server URL.  You can download the btp CLI client version 2.54.0 from SAP Development Tools.
