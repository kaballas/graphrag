The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and see what qualifies as an event. The instructions say that whenever there's a release, upgrade, new capability, etc., we should create an EVENT entity. The name should be a short title followed by the date from \"Valid as Of\" or \"Latest Revision\". \n\nLooking at Record 901: \"Enhancement in Message Mapping Import\" under Cloud Integration. This seems like a new feature, so an EVENT. The date is 2025-05-11. The description mentions importing from Enterprise Repository, so the entity name would be \"ENHANCEMENT IN MESSAGE MAPPING IMPORT — 2025-05-11\" with a description about the import capability.\n\nRecord 902: \"RFC Adapter in Edge Integration Cell runtime\" is a new feature. Same date. EVENT entity with the title and date, description about using RFC adapter in Edge runtime.\n\nRecord 903 and 904 are software version updates. These are changes, so EVENT entities. The titles would be \"SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-05-11\" with descriptions mentioning the version numbers. But wait, the user said if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, but here the component is Cloud Integration, which might be a product. However, the instruction says if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products as entities. But in the examples, like Example A, DigiCert was an organization. Wait, the user's note says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" So if the component is a product (like Cloud Integration), but since TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed entity types, we shouldn't emit it as an organization. So the version updates would be events, not products. So the EVENT for the software version update would be the event, and the product name (SAP Cloud Integration) isn't an entity here. \n\nRecord 905 and 906 are similar, software version updates for Neo environment. Same approach: create EVENT entities for the version changes. \n\nRecords 907-910 are new features in Edge Integration Cell. Each title is a new component or feature, so each would be an EVENT. For example, \"EDGE DEPLOY CONTROLLER COMPONENT SUPPORTED IN DIAGNOSTICS — 2025-05-11\" with the description about selecting the component in diagnostics.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. But in these records, there's no mention of specific organizations or locations. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry and Neo, but those are environments, not organizations. The user's instruction says not to emit products/services/environments as entities unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. So Cloud Foundry and Neo might not be entities here. \n\nLooking at the descriptions, there's no mention of specific organizations, people, or geos. So relationships might not be applicable here. The only possible relationships would be if an event involves an organization, but since the environments are not organizations, there's nothing to link. \n\nSo the output would be a list of EVENT entities for each record that describes a new feature or change, with no relationships since there are no other entities involved.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENT IN MESSAGE MAPPING IMPORT — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>Import message mapping from Enterprise Repository with dependent archives as artifact<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>RFC ADAPTER IN EDGE INTEGRATION CELL RUNTIME — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>RFC adapter now supported in Edge Integration Cell runtime<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Integration updated to 8.29.* with increment 2503<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Integration updated to 6.65.* with increment 2503<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Integration 5.73.* and Adapter Development Kit 2.53.* updated<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Integration 7.38.* rollout with automatic tenant migration<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>EDGE DEPLOY CONTROLLER COMPONENT SUPPORTED IN DIAGNOSTICS — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>Edge Deploy Controller selectable in diagnostic task creation<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>GRAFANA DASHBOARDS FOR SYSTEM MONITORING — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>Grafana dashboards delivered with Edge Integration Cell deployment<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW ACTION ROTATE SIGNING KEY IN COMPONENT MONITOR — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>Manual rotation of signing keys for access tokens in Edge components<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW COMPONENTS IN COMPONENT MONITOR — 2025-05-11<|>EVENT<|>Destination Service Data Maintainer and Rest components added<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925324, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1241, "prompt_tokens": 3850, "total_tokens": 5091, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.19195849546044, "duration": 38.55}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
