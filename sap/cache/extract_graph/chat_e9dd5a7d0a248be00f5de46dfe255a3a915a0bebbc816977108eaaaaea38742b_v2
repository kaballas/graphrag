The user provided some text from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, looking at the first part of the text: \"Tier Option and Trial Account Technical Constraints and Add Documents and Activate/Deactivate Template.\" The action is \"Info only,\" lifecycle is \"General Availability,\" type is \"New,\" and the valid date is 2023-10-09. Since the type is \"New\" and it's under Technology, I need to check if this should be an EVENT. The instructions say to create an EVENT for new capabilities. The title seems to be a feature addition, so I'll make an EVENT entity with the name \"TIER OPTION AND TRIAL ACCOUNT TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS — 2023-10-09\" and a description about the new features.\n\nNext, the second record is about the Telemetry module deprecating LogParser API. The action is \"Required,\" lifecycle is \"Deprecated,\" type is \"Changed,\" valid as of 2023-10-06. This is a deprecation, which is an event. The EVENT name would be \"TELEMETRY MODULE: DEPRECATION OF LOGPARSER API — 2023-10-06\" with a description mentioning the deprecation and the recommended JSON-based logging.\n\nNow, checking for entities. The first EVENT doesn't mention any organizations, people, or geos, so no relationships there. The second EVENT mentions \"Telemetry module\" and \"LogParser API,\" but those are products, not entities unless specified. Since the user said not to emit products/services as entities unless they're explicitly mentioned as organizations. \"Kyma Runtime\" and \"Kyma\" are mentioned in the component and environment. Kyma is a product, but the user's entity types don't include technology, so I shouldn't emit it as an entity. However, the instruction says if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, represent changes as EVENT. Since the user's entity types include organization, person, geo, event, and the TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed list, I should not emit products as entities. So, no organizations, people, or geos here. Therefore, no relationships to emit.\n\nWait, the first record's component is \"Kyma Runtime\" and environment \"Kyma.\" But since the user's entity types don't include technology, I shouldn't emit those as entities. So, only the EVENTs. The output should have the two EVENTs and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>TIER OPTION AND TRIAL ACCOUNT TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS — 2023-10-09<|>EVENT<|>New features: technical constraints for tier options, trial accounts, document management, and template activation/deactivation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TELEMETRY MODULE: DEPRECATION OF LOGPARSER API — 2023-10-06<|>EVENT<|>LogParser API deprecated in Telemetry module 1.1.0; JSON-based logging recommended)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926315, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 686, "prompt_tokens": 2842, "total_tokens": 3528, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.24441833137485, "duration": 21.275}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
