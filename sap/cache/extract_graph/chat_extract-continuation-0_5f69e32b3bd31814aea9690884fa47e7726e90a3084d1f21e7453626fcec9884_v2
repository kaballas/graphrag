The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. I need to go back to the provided contexts and the real data to find any entities that fit the allowed types: organization, person, geo, event.\n\nFirst, looking at the real data provided. The first record is about the autoscaler service plan change. The component is \"Multitarget Applications for Cloud Foundry\" and the environment is Cloud Foundry. The description mentions BTP accounts, trial accounts, and the service plan change. \n\nIn the previous extraction, they created an event for the autoscaler plan change. But maybe \"CLOUD FOUNDRY\" and \"SAP BTP\" should be organizations. Also, \"BTP\" is part of SAP, so SAP BTP is an organization. The term \"CLOUD FOUNDRY\" is a platform, so that's an organization too. \n\nThe second record is about the Authorization and Trust Management Service. The environment includes ABAP, Cloud Foundry, Kyma, Neo, Other. The title mentions token-based authentication for custom trusts. The description refers to SAP BTP subaccounts and SAP Cloud Identity Services. Here, \"SAP CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES\" might be an organization. Also, \"OPENID CONNECT (OIDC)\" is a protocol, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity type, it shouldn't be emitted. \n\nLooking at the contexts provided earlier, there's mention of \"Cloud Foundry\" in multiple places, which is an organization. Also, \"SAP Process Orchestration System\" and \"SAP Document AI\" are products, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, they might be considered events or not emitted. However, the user's instruction says if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, represent changes as EVENT entities. \n\nWait, the user's step says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" So products like SAP Document AI shouldn't be emitted as entities but as events. However, in the previous extraction, they did emit events for the autoscaler and the trust change. \n\nLooking back at the real data, the first record's event was correctly emitted. The second record's event was also emitted. But maybe \"CLOUD FOUNDRY\" and \"SAP BTP\" as organizations were missed. Also, \"SAP CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES\" might be an organization. \n\nIn the first record, the environment is Cloud Foundry, which is an organization. The description mentions BTP accounts, so SAP BTP is an organization. In the second record, the environment includes Cloud Foundry, Kyma, Neo, which are all organizations. Also, the description mentions SAP Cloud Identity Services, which is an organization. \n\nSo, I need to add these organizations. Also, check for any GEOs, but the text doesn't mention any real-world locations. \n\nFor relationships, the autoscaler event involves SAP BTP and Cloud Foundry. The trust event involves SAP BTP subaccounts and SAP Cloud Identity Services. \n\nSo, adding the organizations and relationships accordingly.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud application platform for deploying and managing applications<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP Business Technology Platform providing cloud services and infrastructure<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP service for managing identity and access across cloud environments<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOSCALER DEFAULT SERVICE PLAN CHANGE — 2025-02-20<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Event involves service plan configuration on this platform<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOSCALER DEFAULT SERVICE PLAN CHANGE — 2025-02-20<|>SAP BTP<|>Event impacts service plan availability in BTP accounts<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW CUSTOM TRUSTS TO TOKEN-BASED AUTH — 2025-02-20<|>SAP BTP<|>Event involves authentication configuration for BTP subaccounts<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW CUSTOM TRUSTS TO TOKEN-BASED AUTH — 2025-02-20<|>SAP CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>Event integrates with this identity management service<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926155, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 987, "prompt_tokens": 2846, "total_tokens": 3833, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.36808447840488, "duration": 30.493}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

The change aims to ease the consumption of the free standard service plan which is available by default in all BTP accounts, unlike the lite service plan which is available only in trial accounts.  Action: If you need to create Autoscaler service instances with plan lite, set the MTA resource parameter service-plan to lite.\nAction: Recommended\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-02-10\nValid as Of: 2025-02-20\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1350 ---\nComponent: Authorization and Trust Management Service\nEnvironment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other\nTitle: New Custom Trusts for Business Users Changed to Token-Based Authentication\nDescription: With this release, new OpenID Connect (OIDC) trust configurations between your SAP BTP subaccount and a custom identity provider are configured to use token-based authentication instead of password-based. We've taken this step to improve security and compliance with the OIDC standard. There are no changes to existing trust configurations. We don't expect any impact for our customers.

The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the first record. The title is \"Changed the default service plan of the autoscaler resource type to standard.\" The description mentions Cloud Foundry, BTP accounts, and trial accounts. Since the entity types don't include technology, I need to represent changes as events. The main event here is the change in the default service plan. The event name should be something like \"AUTOSCALER DEFAULT SERVICE PLAN CHANGE — 2025-02-20\" using the Valid as Of date. The description would note the change from lite to standard and the reason.\n\nNext, the second record is about new custom trusts using token-based authentication. The title mentions OpenID Connect (OIDC) and SAP BTP subaccount. Again, this is a change, so an event. The event name could be \"NEW CUSTOM TRUSTS TO TOKEN-BASED AUTH — 2025-02-20\". The description should mention the switch from password-based to token-based for new OIDC trusts, improving security.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. The text mentions SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry, and ABAP, Kyma, Neo, Other environments. But according to the rules, only explicitly mentioned organizations like SAP BTP or Cloud Foundry should be included. However, the user's entity types include organization, but the instructions say not to emit products/services unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. Wait, the note says if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, but here the entity types include organization. Wait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"SAP BTP subaccount\" and \"SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service\". But the instruction says ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned. SAP BTP is a service, but maybe it's considered an organization here. However, the example D had Microsoft Azure as an organization. So maybe SAP BTP is an organization. But the user's examples don't have SAP BTP as an entity. Hmm, maybe I should check if the text explicitly names an organization. The text mentions \"SAP BTP subaccount\" and \"SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service\", but these are services, not organizations. The environments listed are Cloud Foundry, ABAP, Kyma, Neo, Other. Cloud Foundry is a platform, but in the examples, it was treated as part of the event description, not as an entity. Since the user's entity types include organization, but the text doesn't mention a company name like SAP itself, maybe there are no organizations here. So perhaps no organization entities to emit.\n\nFor relationships, the first event (autoscaler plan change) might relate to Cloud Foundry as the environment, but since Cloud Foundry isn't an entity in the output (unless it's considered an organization, which I'm not sure), maybe no relationships. The second event (token-based auth) involves SAP BTP subaccount, but again, if that's not an entity, no relationships. So maybe no relationships to emit.\n\nSo the final output would be two events with their descriptions, and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOSCALER DEFAULT SERVICE PLAN CHANGE — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>Default autoscaler MTA resource plan changed from LITE to STANDARD for BTP accounts; LITE requires explicit configuration<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CUSTOM TRUSTS TO TOKEN-BASED AUTH — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>New OIDC trusts use token-based authentication instead of password-based for SAP BTP subaccounts<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
