The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given guidelines. First, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events or other entities.\n\nStarting with Record 581: \"Off-Cycle Upgrade\" for Cloud Identity Services. The description says they've been upgraded. Since this is a new feature or change, it's an EVENT. The name should be \"CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES UPGRADE — 2025-06-25\" with the description mentioning the upgrade. The entity type is EVENT.\n\nRecord 582: \"Override Conditional Authentication with URL Parameter\" is a change. The description adds an option to the idp parameter. This is a new feature, so EVENT again. Name would be \"OVERRIDE CONDITIONAL AUTHENTICATION WITH URL PARAMETER — 2025-06-25\". Description includes the new option for OIDC.\n\nRecord 583: Joule's new use cases in SAP SuccessFactors. The title mentions \"New Use Cases for SAP SuccessFactors Available in Joule - June 2025\". The valid date is 2025-06-25. This is an EVENT. The description lists the new use cases like fixing login issues and viewing company data.\n\nRecord 584: Joule supporting SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. The title is \"New Use Cases Now Supported in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition\". Valid as Of is 2025-06-25. EVENT entity with the description about viewing business data like Process Order.\n\nRecord 585: Telemetry module update to version 1.42.0. This is a change in Kyma Runtime. The description mentions improvements in traces, metrics, and logs. EVENT name: \"TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE TO VERSION 1.42.0 — 2025-06-25\". Description includes the updates to OTel Collector and Fluent Bit.\n\nRecord 586: Docusign Receiver Adapter available. New in Cloud Integration. EVENT: \"DOCUSIGN RECEIVER ADAPTER AVAILABLE — 2025-06-24\". Description states it's now available.\n\nRecord 587: Google BigQuery Receiver Adapter available. Similar to 586, EVENT: \"GOOGLE BIGQUERY RECEIVER ADAPTER AVAILABLE — 2025-06-24\". Description mentions availability.\n\nRecord 588: Istio module update to 1.18.1. Fixes an issue with external authorizers. EVENT: \"ISTIO MODULE UPDATE TO VERSION 1.18.1 — 2025-06-24\". Description includes the fix.\n\nRecord 589: Add a Placeholder to a Process in SAP Build Process Automation. New feature. EVENT: \"ADD A PLACEHOLDER TO A PROCESS — 2025-06-24\". Description allows replacing with an activity later.\n\nRecord 590: Import BPMN Process. New feature. EVENT: \"IMPORT A BPMN PROCESS — 2025-06-24\". Description allows importing from other tools.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The guidelines say to link events to organizations, geos, or other events. However, most of these events are about features or updates within SAP products. Since the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and the records don't mention specific organizations beyond the product names (like Cloud Foundry, Kyma, etc.), which are environments, not organizations. The examples in the instructions show that when technology isn't an organization, it's represented as an event. So, there might not be relationships here because the events are about features within SAP's own services, not involving external organizations or locations. Therefore, no relationships are emitted.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES UPGRADE — 2025-06-25<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services have been upgraded across Cloud Foundry, Kyma, and Neo environments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>OVERRIDE CONDITIONAL AUTHENTICATION WITH URL PARAMETER — 2025-06-25<|>EVENT<|>Added idp parameter option to override conditional authentication with Identity Authentication for OIDC logon)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW JOULE USE CASES IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2025-06-25<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports fixing login issues and viewing company data in SAP SuccessFactors)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE SUPPORT FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-06-25<|>EVENT<|>Joule enables viewing business data like Process Order in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE TO VERSION 1.42.0 — 2025-06-25<|>EVENT<|>Kyma Runtime telemetry module updated with OTel Collector 0.127.0 and Fluent Bit 4.0.3)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUSIGN RECEIVER ADAPTER AVAILABLE — 2025-06-24<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Integration now supports Docusign Receiver Adapter for document handling)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE BIGQUERY RECEIVER ADAPTER AVAILABLE — 2025-06-24<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Integration now supports Google BigQuery Receiver Adapter for data processing)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ISTIO MODULE UPDATE TO VERSION 1.18.1 — 2025-06-24<|>EVENT<|>Kyma Runtime Istio module fixed to handle multiple external authorizers correctly)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ADD A PLACEHOLDER TO A PROCESS — 2025-06-24<|>EVENT<|>SAP Build Process Automation allows adding placeholders to processes for later replacement)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IMPORT A BPMN PROCESS — 2025-06-24<|>EVENT<|>SAP Build Process Automation supports importing BPMN processes from external tools)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926146, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1379, "prompt_tokens": 3951, "total_tokens": 5330, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.348870487227, "duration": 42.629}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
