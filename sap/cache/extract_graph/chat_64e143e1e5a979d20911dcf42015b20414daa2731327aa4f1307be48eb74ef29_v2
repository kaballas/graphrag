Action  If you're affected, ensure that your application works with asynchronous service instance creation and update before the end-of-life date.  To test, remove xsenableasyncservice from the security descriptor prior to the change. If you use the element with the value true, you can remove it without any impact.  In addition, consider adapting any Cloud Foundry CLI commands in your scripts so that they wait for processing to complete:    cf create-service xsuaa application xsuaa-app -c security.json --wait  cf update-service xsuaa-app -c security.json --wait    Note  Cloud Foundry CLI version 8 and later supports the --wait option.

To learn more, see: Removal of SAP Java Buildpack 1    Unfortunately, there are still applications depending on it. To prevent disruptions and support business continuity as much as possible, we're postponing its removal to December 31, 2025. That's your last chance, there are going to be no more extensions.   Caution      Effective October 1, we're renaming the buildpack to sap_java_buildpack_to_be_removed.       The old name, sap_java_buildpack, will stay for a while but then we'll gradually remove it from our Cloud Foundry environment.       Both buidlpack names point to the same version (currently, 1.115.0).      Action:  If you have applications still running on sap_java_buildpack, you have two options:     [RECOMMENDED] Migrate them to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta as soon as possible! To learn how, see: Migrate your Applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2  [WORKAROUND] To keep using SAP Java Buildpack 1 till the end of 2025, open your manifest.yml or mtad.yaml files, replace sap_java_buildpack with sap_java_buildpack_to_be_removed, and then restage or redeploy your applications.
