The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, looking at the text, there are three records. Each has a component, environment, title, description, etc. The key is to identify events and other entities.\n\nStarting with Record 1139: The title is \"Display the Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations in a Form\". The description mentions the admin dashboard now displays verified credentials. This seems like a new feature, so an EVENT entity. The name should be something like \"DISPLAY VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS IN FORM — 2025-03-27\" since \"Valid as Of\" is 2025-03-27. The description would be about the admin dashboard showing verified credentials and presentations.\n\nNext, Record 1140: Title is \"Support for X.509 Authentication\". The description says the APIs now support X.509. Another new feature, so another EVENT. Name would be \"X.509 AUTHENTICATION SUPPORT — 2025-03-27\". Description mentions APIs supporting X.509 auth.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. The environment is Cloud Foundry, which is an organization. So \"CLOUD FOUNDRY\" as an organization with a description about the environment. \n\nNo GEOs or PERSONs mentioned, so those are out. \n\nRelationships: The events are related to Cloud Foundry as the environment. So each event would have a relationship with Cloud Foundry, indicating the event occurs in that organization's environment. Strength around 8 or 9.\n\nNeed to make sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formatted. Also, check if any products/services are mistakenly included, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity type, they should be part of the EVENT descriptions instead.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DISPLAY VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS IN FORM — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>Admin dashboard displays verified verifiable credentials and presentations in form interface)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>X.509 AUTHENTICATION SUPPORT — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>Personalized Recommendation APIs now support X.509 authentication method)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud application platform providing environment for decentralized identity verification features)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DISPLAY VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS IN FORM — 2025-03-27<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Event occurs within this cloud platform environment<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>X.509 AUTHENTICATION SUPPORT — 2025-03-27<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Event occurs within this cloud platform environment<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925248, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 660, "prompt_tokens": 2957, "total_tokens": 3617, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 33.919210607462226, "duration": 19.458}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
