These new procedures split the upgrade process into three phases: a preparation phase, a short takeover phase, and a postprocessing phase. The preparation phase installs the new platform release into a shadow layer of the system. The takeover phase switches to the new platform version. The switch to the new platform release happens within a shortened downtime of 20 to 40 minutes. Finalization tasks and clean-up steps run in the postprocessing phase. Both the preparation phase as well as the postprocessing phase run in the background during uptime of the system. Some lifecycle management activities, like the import of transports or tenant creation, are blocked during the preparation phase. These new procedures were already applied during recent upgrades, but will become even more beneficial with the planned system-specific announcement of precise technical downtime. In the first phase, we provide this feature to production systems running on 4 or more HANA Consumption Units.\";\"Info only\";\"General Availability\";\"New\";\"Technology\";\"2025-09-03\";\"2025-08-15\";\"ABAP Environment 2508\"\n\"ABAP Environment\";\"ABAP\";\"Referenced SAPUI5 Version\";\"As part of hotfix collection 4 (which is used for the standard upgrade), SAPUI5 version 1.136.4 is used for the administrator’s SAP Fiori launchpad, SAP-delivered Fiori apps, and the custom-built SAP Fiori apps, which are deployed to the ABAP system.
