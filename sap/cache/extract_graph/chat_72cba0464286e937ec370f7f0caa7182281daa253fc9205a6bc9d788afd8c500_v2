The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given guidelines. First, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. \n\nLooking at the first record, Record 3291: It's about SAP Build adding a Resources feature in the Lobby. Since it's a new feature, that's an event. The title mentions \"Lobby - All Resources Option\" and the description talks about new tools. The valid as of date is 2024-03-15. So the event name would be \"LOBBY - ALL RESOURCES OPTION — 2024-03-15\" with a description about the new resources feature.\n\nNext, Record 3292: Enhanced Last Accessed Column Details. Again, a new feature in the Lobby, adding the year to the date. Event name: \"LOBBY - ENHANCED LAST ACCESSED COLUMN DETAILS — 2024-03-15\". Description mentions easier tracking of projects.\n\nRecord 3293: UI Improvements in Import Project with an Import in Progress tag. Event name: \"LOBBY - UI IMPROVEMENTS IN IMPORT PROJECT — 2024-03-15\". Description about the tag indicating project import status.\n\nRecord 3294: Deprecated Tags for Store Packages. This is a new feature introducing deprecated tags. Event name: \"STORE - INTRODUCING DEPRECATED TAGS FOR STORE PACKAGES — 2024-03-15\". Description about identifying outdated packages.\n\nRecord 3295: Support for REST API based custom action. This is an announcement about deprecating CUSTOM_ACTION. Event name: \"SUPPORT FOR REST API BASED CUSTOM ACTION — 2024-03-13\". Description mentions deprecating CUSTOM_ACTION and recommending REST API.\n\nRecord 3296: Supported versions for Cloud Build Service. This is a new feature listing supported versions. Event name: \"SUPPORTED VERSIONS FOR CLOUD BUILD SERVICE — 2024-03-13\". Description about updated versions for the service.\n\nRecord 3297: Enhancements to Configure Omnichannel Promotion Pricing app. New changes in the app. Event name: \"ENHANCEMENTS TO CONFIGURE OMINICHANNEL PROMOTION PRICING APP — 2024-03-13\". Description includes renaming sections and new settings.\n\nRecord 3298: Reusing a Merchandise Set. New feature allowing reuse. Event name: \"REUSING A MERCHANDISE SET — 2024-03-13\". Description about creating a merchandise set with reference.\n\nRecord 3299: Security Recommendation on Extensibility. New information about security. Event name: \"SECURITY RECOMMENDATION ON EXTENSIBILITY — 2024-03-13\". Description mentions learning about security recommendations.\n\nNow, checking for organizations, persons, or geos. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry and Neo, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed entity types, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted. Since the entity types here are organization, person, geo, event, and the records don't mention specific organizations beyond SAP components, which are part of the product names, not separate entities. So no organizations, persons, or geos to extract. All events are based on the changes described. \n\nRelationships: Since there are no organizations or geos mentioned, there are no relationships to extract. Each event is standalone. So the output will be the list of events without any relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>LOBBY - ALL RESOURCES OPTION — 2024-03-15<|>EVENT<|>SAP BUILD NOW OFFERS RESOURCES FEATURE FOR NAVIGATING ROADMAP, LEARNING JOURNEYS, MISSIONS, AND MORE<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>LOBBY - ENHANCED LAST ACCESSED COLUMN DETAILS — 2024-03-15<|>EVENT<|>LAST ACCESSED COLUMN NOW SHOWS DATE AND YEAR FOR EASIER PROJECT TRACKING<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>LOBBY - UI IMPROVEMENTS IN IMPORT PROJECT — 2024-03-15<|>EVENT<|>IMPORT IN PROGRESS TAG ADDS TRANSPARENCY TO PROJECT IMPORT STATUS<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>STORE - INTRODUCING DEPRECATED TAGS FOR STORE PACKAGES — 2024-03-15<|>EVENT<|>DEPRECATED TAG IDENTIFIES UNUPDATED PACKAGES FOR REMOVAL<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORT FOR REST API BASED CUSTOM ACTION — 2024-03-13<|>EVENT<|>REST API SUPPORT FOR CUSTOM SITUATION ACTIONS REPLACES DEPRECATED CUSTOM_ACTION<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORTED VERSIONS FOR CLOUD BUILD SERVICE — 2024-03-13<|>EVENT<|>UPDATED SUPPORTED VERSIONS FOR CLOUD BUILD SERVICE INCLUDING FIORI KAPSEL, IOS, AND SDK<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO CONFIGURE OMINICHANNEL PROMOTION PRICING APP — 2024-03-13<|>EVENT<|>RENAMED PADDING CONFIGURATIONS TO IDENTIFIER FORMATS WITH NEW ADDITIONAL SETTINGS<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>REUSING A MERCHANDISE SET — 2024-03-13<|>EVENT<|>CREATE MERCHANDISE SET WITH REFERENCE TO REUSE ACROSS PROMOTIONS<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SECURITY RECOMMENDATION ON EXTENSIBILITY — 2024-03-13<|>EVENT<|>NEW SECURITY GUIDANCE FOR EXTENSIBILITY IN OMINICHANNEL PROMOTION PRICING<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926271, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1333, "prompt_tokens": 3950, "total_tokens": 5283, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.388172121388834, "duration": 41.157}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
