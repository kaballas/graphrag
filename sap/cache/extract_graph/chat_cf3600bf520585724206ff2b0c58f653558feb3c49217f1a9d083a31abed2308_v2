The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records using the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records mention SAP components and features, I need to check if any of them qualify as events. \n\nLooking at Record 311: It's about new AI features in SAP Build Work Zone. The description mentions a promotional period until 2025-12-31. This seems like an event. The title is \"Text Generation & Summarization Using AI\", so the event name would be \"TEXT GENERATION & SUMMARIZATION USING AI — 2025-08-13\" with the description mentioning the AI features and the promotional period.\n\nRecord 312-314 are about Variant Configuration API changes. These are updates or changes, which might be events. However, the titles are more about specific API features. The \"Ability to Set Default Values\" and \"Map New AVC Author\" could be events. But the user's examples show that even technical changes are considered events. So I'll create events for each of these, using the valid as of date (2025-08-13) and the titles.\n\nRecord 315: Automatic Version Selection in Job Creation. This is a change in the Continuous Integration & Delivery component. The event name would be \"AUTOMATIC VERSION SELECTION IN JOB CREATION — 2025-08-12\" with the description about the version selection drop-down being removed.\n\nRecord 316: APIRule v1beta1 deletion timeline in Kyma Runtime. This is a required action and a deprecation, which is an event. The event name would be \"APIRULE V1BETA1 DELETION TIMELINE — 2025-08-12\" with the description about the deprecation timeline and migration required.\n\nNow, checking for organizations, geos, or persons. The records mention SAP components and environments like Cloud Foundry and Kyma, but according to the rules, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities unless they are organizations. However, \"Kyma\" is an environment, but the user's examples don't include environments as entities unless they are organizations. Since Kyma is a product, but the entity types don't include technology, so maybe they are not emitted. The only organization mentioned is SAP, but the examples don't include that. Wait, the user's examples in the validation section mention SAP BTP as an organization. However, in the given records, the components are parts of SAP products, but the entity types are limited to organization, person, geo, event. Since the records don't mention specific organizations beyond SAP, but the user's examples don't include SAP as an entity unless it's part of the event name. \n\nWait, the user's example D includes Microsoft Azure as an organization. In the current records, the environments are Cloud Foundry and Kyma, but those are environments, not organizations. So perhaps no organizations are present here. The only possible organization is SAP, but the user's examples don't include that. So maybe no organizations are emitted. \n\nFor relationships, the events might be related to the environments or components, but according to the rules, relationships are only between events and organizations or geos. Since there are no organizations or geos in the events, there might be no relationships. \n\nSo the final output would be the events extracted from each record, with no relationships since there are no qualifying entities for relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>TEXT GENERATION & SUMMARIZATION USING AI — 2025-08-13<|>EVENT<|>AI summarization, comment generation, and text generation features available in SAP Build Work Zone with promotional usage terms until 2025-12-31)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ABILITY TO SET DEFAULT VALUES — 2025-08-13<|>EVENT<|>New API input field allows setting default values for characteristics in Variant Configuration, with limited support and exceptions)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MAP NEW AVC AUTHOR — 2025-08-13<|>EVENT<|>AVC author 7 introduced for classification-based characteristic values, resolving errors during AVC forwarding)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PERSIST USER VALUES INVOLVED IN CONFLICTS — 2025-08-13<|>EVENT<|>Conflicts from user/system value overlaps in Variant Configuration now consistently reported and resolved)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOMATIC VERSION SELECTION IN JOB CREATION — 2025-08-12<|>EVENT<|>Latest pipeline version auto-selected during job creation in Continuous Integration & Delivery, removing manual version dropdown)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>APIRULE V1BETA1 DELETION TIMELINE — 2025-08-12<|>EVENT<|>Deprecation of APIRule v1beta1 in Kyma Runtime with phased removal and mandatory migration to v2 by end-2025)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926029, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1130, "prompt_tokens": 3920, "total_tokens": 5050, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.94617211353613, "duration": 35.372}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

The following timeline outlines the steps we will take to phase out version v1beta1:  Kyma dashboard won't display APIRule CRs in version v1beta1. All APIRules v1beta1 will be fully operational from the command line, and you will still be able to manage them using kubectl. This change will not affect any pipelines that manage APIRules using Kubernetes utilities such as kubectl or helm.    Fast channel release date: August 18, 2025  Regular channel release date: September 1, 2025      You won't be able to create APIRule CRs v1beta1 in new clusters. In existing clusters, you will still be able to create and modify APIRule CRs v1beta1.  Fast channel release date: End of October, 2025  Regular channel release date: Mid-November, 2025    You won't be able to create APIRule CRs v1beta1 in new and existing clusters, modify existing APIRule CRs v1beta1, or delete them. All APIRule v1beta1 configurations set up prior to this restriction will remain active and continue to function as expected. The API Gateway module will manage and reconcile resources based on the existing APIRule settings.  Fast channel release date: Mid-November, 2025  Regular channel release date: End of the year 2025      Required action: Migrate all your APIRules to version v2. To learn how to do this, see APIRule Migration. We strongly recommend that you start the migration as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_cf3600bf520585724206ff2b0c58f653558feb3c49217f1a9d083a31abed2308_v2"}
