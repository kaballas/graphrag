The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records mention various SAP components and features, I need to check if they qualify as events. \n\nLooking at Record 481: It's about a new read-only role in SAP BTP cockpit. This is a new feature, so it's an event. The title is \"Read-Only Roles\" with a valid date. The entity name would be \"READ-ONLY ROLES — 2025-07-10\" as an event. The description mentions the role name and its purpose.\n\nRecord 482: SAP Cloud Transport Management service catalog available in SAP Automation Pilot. This is a new feature, so another event. The entity name would be \"SAP CLOUD TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT SERVICE CATALOG AVAILABILITY — 2025-07-10\". The description includes the ability to manage transport nodes via SAP Automation Pilot.\n\nRecord 483: Custom flag attributes in Feature Flags Service. This is a new feature, so event. Entity name: \"CUSTOM FLAG ATTRIBUTES — 2025-07-10\". Description about creating rules based on custom attributes.\n\nRecord 484: New btp CLI client version 2.90.2. This is a change, so event. Entity name: \"BTP CLI CLIENT VERSION 2.90.2 RELEASE — 2025-07-10\". Description includes the improvements added in this version.\n\nRecord 485: Data migration from HCM to SAP Build Work Zone. This is an announcement, so event. Entity name: \"DATA MIGRATION FROM HCM TO SAP BUILD WORK ZONE — 2025-07-10\". Description about opening a support ticket for migration.\n\nRecord 486: HTML Business Solutions without Destinations. New feature, event. Entity name: \"HTML BUSINESS SOLUTIONS WITHOUT DESTINATIONS — 2025-07-10\". Description allows creating content channels without defining destinations.\n\nRecord 487: Read-Only Roles in SAP Build Work Zone. Similar to 481, but for a different component. Event name: \"READ-ONLY ROLES IN SAP BUILD WORK ZONE — 2025-07-10\". Description about the role names and access restrictions.\n\nRecord 488: UX improvements to Page Editor. This is an enhancement, so event. Entity name: \"UX IMPROVEMENTS TO PAGE EDITOR — 2025-07-10\". Description lists the UI changes made.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The events are related to SAP BTP, SAP Build Work Zone, etc., but the user's examples didn't include relationships for these unless they involve organizations, geo, or person. Since the records don't mention specific organizations beyond SAP components, and no geo or person entities, there might be no relationships to emit. \n\nWait, in the examples, when a product is mentioned, like Joule in Sydney, Australia, they linked it to Microsoft Azure (organization) and Sydney (geo). But here, the components are part of SAP's services. However, according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services are represented as events. Since the entity types include organization, but the records don't mention other organizations besides SAP's own services, maybe there are no relationships. \n\nSo, the output will have the events and no relationships. Each event is standalone. Need to make sure the entity names are uppercase, descriptions are concise, and follow the format.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>READ-ONLY ROLES — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>New admin read-only role (Portal_Admin_Read_Only) added to SAP BTP cockpit for support access without data changes)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP CLOUD TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT SERVICE CATALOG AVAILABILITY — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>SAP Automation Pilot now manages transport nodes, routes, and requests for SAP Cloud Transport Management)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM FLAG ATTRIBUTES — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>Feature Flags Service allows custom rules for delivering variations based on user-defined attributes)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BTP CLI CLIENT VERSION 2.90.2 RELEASE — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>New btp CLI version adds favorites, login server selection, and --jwt parameter for OIDC providers)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DATA MIGRATION FROM HCM TO SAP BUILD WORK ZONE — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>Customers must open support tickets to migrate data from SAP Jam to SAP Build Work Zone)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HTML BUSINESS SOLUTIONS WITHOUT DESTINATIONS — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>HTML5 business solutions can now be created without defining destinations in SAP Build Work Zone)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>READ-ONLY ROLES IN SAP BUILD WORK ZONE — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>New roles (Workzone_Admin_Read_Only, HR_Workzone_Admin_Read_Only) restrict support access to admin configurations)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>UX IMPROVEMENTS TO PAGE EDITOR — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>Workpage editor now distinguishes layout/content elements with hover-based settings and content-type separation)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926453, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1258, "prompt_tokens": 3928, "total_tokens": 5186, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.019140217363635, "duration": 39.289}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
