The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the given text based on the provided guidelines. First, I need to parse the input text and identify the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the first part of the text: \"selected SAP AI Core runtime. The message appears in SAP AI Launchpad for all generative AI hub users of that connection. For more information, see Create a Disclaimer.\" The key points here are SAP AI Core, SAP AI Launchpad, and the action related to generative AI hub users. The valid as of date is 2024-02-15. Since the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, I need to check if any of these fit. \n\nSAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad are products, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products shouldn't be emitted as entities. However, the user's entity types include organization, so maybe SAP is considered an organization. Wait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The instruction says that if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products/services. But in this case, the entity types include organization, so maybe SAP as an organization is allowed. However, the text mentions \"SAP AI Core\" and \"SAP AI Launchpad\" which are products, but the user's entity types don't include technology. Wait, the user's entity_types are organization, person, geo, event. So products like SAP AI Core wouldn't be entities unless they are organizations. But SAP is an organization, so maybe SAP is the organization here. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention SAP as an organization, just the products. Hmm, this is tricky. The rule says if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, don't emit products. Since the user's entity_types don't include technology, products shouldn't be emitted. So maybe there's no organization here. But the action is \"Info only\" and the lifecycle is \"General Availability\", which might be an event. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, etc. The first text mentions \"selected SAP AI Core runtime\" and the message appearing in SAP AI Launchpad. This seems like a new feature or change, so that could be an event. The valid as of date is 2024-02-15. So the event name would be something like \"SAP AI CORE RUNTIME SELECTION — 2024-02-15\" with a description about the message appearing in SAP AI Launchpad for users. But since SAP AI Core and Launchpad are products, and the user's entity types don't include technology, they can't be emitted as entities. So the event is the main entity here. \n\nNext, the second record: \"Email Notifications\" under Cloud Identity Services. The description says SAP Cloud Identity Services can send emails to tenant admins. The valid as of date is 2024-02-13. This is a new feature, so another event. The event name would be \"EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS FOR CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES — 2024-02-13\" with a description about sending emails to admins. Again, SAP Cloud Identity Services is a product, but since technology isn't an allowed entity type, we can't emit it. So the event is the entity here. \n\nNow, checking for relationships. The first event might involve SAP as an organization, but the text doesn't explicitly mention SAP as an organization. The second event is about Cloud Identity Services, which is a product, but again, not an allowed entity. So maybe there are no relationships to emit. \n\nWait, the user's example D had relationships between the event and the organization and geo. In this case, if there's no explicit mention of an organization or geo, then no relationships. So the output would be two events with no relationships. \n\nBut I need to make sure I'm not missing any organizations. The text mentions \"SAP Cloud Identity Services\" and \"SAP AI Launchpad\", but since the entity types don't include technology, those aren't emitted. The only possible organization is SAP, but the text doesn't explicitly state that. So maybe no organizations here. \n\nSo the final output would be two events with no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP AI CORE RUNTIME SELECTION — 2024-02-15<|>EVENT<|>Message displayed in SAP AI Launchpad for generative AI hub users regarding selected runtime<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS FOR CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES — 2024-02-13<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Identity Services sends email notifications to tenant administrators about new applications<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925743, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1023, "prompt_tokens": 2866, "total_tokens": 3889, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.57115081936858, "duration": 32.403}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
