The user provided a detailed instruction on how to extract entities and relationships from the given text based on specific entity types and rules. The text includes two records from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes.\n\nFirst, I need to parse each record and identify the events. The first record is about Cloud Logging's update to index sizing. The key points are the improvement in stability, the change from daily indexes to a rollover approach with new index names, and the impact on users querying old indexes. This should be an EVENT entity with a name like \"CLOUD LOGGING INDEX SIZING UPDATE — 2025-04-17\" and a description summarizing the changes.\n\nNext, the second record is about the opt-in control for force deletion of subaccounts in SAP BTP. The main points are the new safeguard requiring opt-in, the restriction for production subaccounts, and the impact on automation. This would be another EVENT entity named \"OPT-IN CONTROL FOR FORCE DELETION OF SUBACCOUNTS — 2025-04-17\" with a description explaining the changes.\n\nNow, checking for entities. The first event involves \"CLOUD LOGGING\" as part of the environment (Cloud Foundry), but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, products/services shouldn't be entities. However, the user's entity types include EVENT, so the event itself is the entity. The second event mentions \"SAP BTP COCKPIT\" and \"SAP BTP,\" but again, these are part of the environment, not entities unless specified. Since the user's entity types don't include TECHNOLOGY, these might not be emitted as entities. However, the examples show that even if the product is mentioned, it's not an entity unless it's an organization. \n\nLooking at the examples, in Example D, \"Microsoft Azure\" is an organization. Here, \"SAP BTP\" is a service, but since the entity types don't include TECHNOLOGY, it shouldn't be an entity. So, the only entities are the events themselves. \n\nFor relationships, the first event (Cloud Logging) might relate to \"CLOUD FOUNDRY\" as the environment, but the user's entity types don't include TECHNOLOGY, so that's not an entity. The second event (SAP BTP) is part of the environment, but again, not an entity. Therefore, there might be no relationships to emit since the required entities (organization, person, geo) aren't present in the text. \n\nWait, the first record's environment is Cloud Foundry, which is a Cloud Foundry environment. But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services aren't entities. The user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. So, Cloud Foundry is a technology, not an entity. Therefore, no relationships here. \n\nSo, the output should have two EVENT entities and no relationships. Let me check the examples again. In Example C, the entity is the event itself. So, the output should be two events with their descriptions, and no relationships since there are no other entities involved.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD LOGGING INDEX SIZING UPDATE — 2025-04-17<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters improved with index rollover; new index names use six-digit numbers instead of date suffixes; queries must adapt to new patterns>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPT-IN CONTROL FOR FORCE DELETION OF SUBACCOUNTS — 2025-04-17<|>EVENT<|>SAP BTP requires opt-in for subaccount force deletion; production subaccounts cannot be force-deleted regardless of global settings>)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926249, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 795, "prompt_tokens": 3670, "total_tokens": 4465, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.342052805012, "duration": 24.581}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

We're going to make the following change for security reasons. Redirect URIs without wildcards only match the exact entry.  If you've deployed custom web applications and defined OAuth redirect URIs without wildcards (*), the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service accepts arbitrary subdomains and paths.    Example  The allowed URI https://myhost.com matches also the following specific values:      https://myhost.com/somepath      https://somesubdomain.myhost.com      This isn't allowed anymore. Only https://myhost.com is accepted after the change.    Action  For affected applications, update the redirect URIs in the application security descriptor with the specific URI and/or wildcards. This ensures that they match the specific URIs during user logon after the stricter rules are in effect.  For more information, see Application Security Descriptor Configuration Syntax.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-04-03\nValid as Of: 2025-04-17\nVersion: 2503a\n\n--- Record 1019 ---\nComponent: Cloud Logging\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Update to: Improvement of the overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters by proper index sizing.\nDescription: Rollout of Index sizing - Improvement of the overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters by proper index sizing.  The overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters will be improved by proper index sizing, especially in high-ingest and huge storage volume scenarios. To achieve this, we will switch from daily indexes to the index rollover approach targeting the updated release date - 17. April 2025.  With this change, the index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., logs-json-2024.11.19), but a six-digit number (e.g., logs-json-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you run queries against the old index suffix. In such cases you need to adapt:      Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.          If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern instead of targeting individual indexes.          Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.      This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-02-10\nValid as Of: 2025-04-17\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1020 ---\nComponent: SAP BTP Cockpit\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Neo\nTitle: Opt-In Control for Force Deletion of Subaccounts in SAP BTP\nDescription: To prevent accidental force deletion of subaccounts containing content, SAP BTP introduces new safeguards:    Global account administrators must now opt in to allow force deletion of subaccounts via a dedicated global account setting. This setting is located under the Subaccounts section in the global account settings and is labeled Enable Subaccounts Force Deletion. For more details on how to access and manage global account settings, see  Managing Global Accounts Using the Cockpit (Cloud Foundry) and  Managing Global Accounts Using the Cockpit (Neo environment).       Force deletion is only allowed for subaccounts not marked as Used for production. If a subaccount is marked as Used for production force deletion is always prohibited, regardless of the global setting. To modify the Used for production status of a subaccount, use the Edit Subaccount action in the Account Explorer See:     Change Subaccount Details for Cloud Foundry      Change Subaccount Details for the Neo environment          These changes apply across the SAP BTP cockpit, btp CLI, and API operations    Note  Any automation or manual operation relying on force deletion will be blocked unless:    The global setting Enable Subaccounts Force Deletion is explicitly enabled by the global account admin      The subaccount is not marked as Used for production.      \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-01\nValid as Of: 2025-04-17\nVersion: Cloud\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_676796c54f4b604378b5ad3cc18acfdfc92b4f40e6d72495cb7790e973b9d473_v2"}
