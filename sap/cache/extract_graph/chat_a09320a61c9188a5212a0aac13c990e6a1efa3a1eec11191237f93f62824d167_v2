The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify the entities. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. Let's start with Record 1301. The title is \"Microsoft 365 Cloud SDK\" and the description mentions enhancing the Microsoft 365 SDK with Excel Online activities. Since \"Microsoft 365\" is a product, but the rules say if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, we should represent changes as EVENT. However, the entity types here include organization, so maybe Microsoft is an organization. Wait, the user's example D had Microsoft Azure as an organization. So \"Microsoft 365\" might be part of Microsoft, which is an organization. But the rules say to emit products/services/environments as entities only if TECHNOLOGY is in the allowed types. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" But in the entity_types provided here, TECHNOLOGY isn't listed. Wait, the user's current entity_types are organization, person, geo, event. So, products like Microsoft 365 Cloud SDK would be considered TECHNOLOGY, which isn't in the allowed entity types. Therefore, we shouldn't emit them as entities but instead create EVENT entities for the changes. \n\nLooking at Record 1301: The description is about adding activities to the Microsoft 365 SDK. Since the entity_types don't include TECHNOLOGY, we can't emit \"Microsoft 365 Cloud SDK\" as an organization. Instead, we create an EVENT for the enhancement. The event name would be something like \"ENHANCEMENTS TO MICROSOFT 365 CLOUD SDK — 2025-03-03\" with a description about the new activities. \n\nNext, Record 1302: \"Run in parallel\" is a new feature. Again, this is a TECHNOLOGY-related change, so we create an EVENT entity for enabling parallel runs. \n\nRecord 1303: \"Best Practices for Outlook Activities\" allows sending emails on behalf of someone. This is a new feature, so another EVENT entity. \n\nRecord 1304: Enhancements to Excel SDK. Similar to Record 1301, we can't emit Excel SDK as an entity, so create an EVENT. \n\nRecord 1305: Same as 1301, another Microsoft 365 SDK enhancement. But since it's the same component, maybe the event is the same? Wait, the title is the same, but the description is similar. However, the valid as of date is 2025-03-03, so maybe it's a separate event? Or perhaps it's the same as Record 1301. Need to check if they are duplicates. The titles are the same, but the components are different (SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation vs. SAP Build Process Automation). So maybe two separate events? Or maybe they are the same feature added in different components. Hmm, but the user's examples don't have duplicates, so perhaps each record is treated as a separate event. \n\nRecord 1306: Update to SAP BTP Operator module version 1.2.0. This is a new version, so an EVENT. The component is Kyma Runtime, but the entity_types don't include TECHNOLOGY, so we can't emit Kyma Runtime as an entity. Instead, the event is about the update. \n\nRecord 1307: New region \"US West (Oregon)\" in Cloud Foundry on AWS. Here, \"US West (Oregon)\" is a GEO, and \"Amazon Web Services\" is an ORGANIZATION. So we can emit both as entities. The event is the availability of the new region. \n\nRecord 1308: Support for video subtitle formats .srt and .vtt. This is a new feature in SAP Translation Hub, so an EVENT. \n\nRecord 1309: Support for Verifiable Presentations with embedded proofs. Another EVENT. \n\nNow, for relationships. For example, in Record 1307, the event \"US WEST (OREGON) AVAILABILITY — 2025-02-28\" would have a relationship with \"AMAZON WEB SERVICES\" (ORGANIZATION) as the infrastructure provider, and \"US WEST (OREGON)\" (GEO) as the location. \n\nOther records may not have clear relationships. For example, the events related to Microsoft 365 SDK might not have direct relationships unless they mention an organization or location. \n\nI need to make sure all entities are correctly categorized and relationships are only between emitted entities. Also, check for valid GEOs and ORGANIZATIONS. For example, \"Amazon Web Services\" is a valid organization, \"US West (Oregon)\" is a valid GEO. \n\nNow, compiling all the entities and relationships according to the rules.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO MICROSOFT 365 CLOUD SDK — 2025-03-03<|>EVENT<|>Added Excel Online activities: Get UsedRange Row/Column for active worksheets)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RUN IN PARALLEL FEATURE ENABLED — 2025-03-03<|>EVENT<|>Support for parallel execution of list items in SAP Build Process Automation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>OUTLOOK EMAIL ON BEHALF SUPPORT — 2025-03-03<|>EVENT<|>Enable sending emails on behalf of others in SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EXCEL SDK ENHANCEMENTS — 2025-03-03<|>EVENT<|>Added sensitivity label management and used range activities for Excel workbooks)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT 365 CLOUD SDK ENHANCEMENTS — 2025-03-03<|>EVENT<|>Added Excel Online activities for used range retrieval in worksheets)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP OPERATOR MODULE UPDATE — 2025-02-28<|>EVENT<|>Customization enabled for sap-btp-manager Secret in Kyma Runtime)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>US WEST (OREGON) AVAILABILITY — 2025-02-28<|>EVENT<|>New Cloud Foundry region on Amazon Web Services for enterprise accounts)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>VIDEO SUBTITLE FORMAT SUPPORT — 2025-02-28<|>EVENT<|>Added .srt and .vtt subtitle format support in Document Translation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>VERIFIABLE PRESENTATIONS UPDATE — 2025-01-01<|>EVENT<|>Support for verifiable credentials with embedded proofs in Decentralized Identity Verification)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON WEB SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform hosting Cloud Foundry's US West (Oregon) region)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>US WEST (OREGON)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Amazon Web Services)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>US WEST (OREGON) AVAILABILITY — 2025-02-28<|>AMAZON WEB SERVICES<|>Event utilizes infrastructure provided by this organization<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>US WEST (OREGON) AVAILABILITY — 2025-02-28<|>US WEST (OREGON)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925906, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1725, "prompt_tokens": 3947, "total_tokens": 5672, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.15104467597339, "duration": 53.653}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
