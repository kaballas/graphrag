The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" release notes based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the Line of Business is Technology, products/services aren't entities but should be represented as events.\n\nStarting with Record 3206: The title is \"Rebranding Changes\" and the description mentions renaming SAP Master Data Orchestration to Business Data Orchestration. This is a change, so it's an event. The event name would be \"REBRANDING OF SAP MASTER DATA ORCHESTRATION — 2024-04-01\" with a description about the rebranding. No organizations or geos here, so no relationships.\n\nRecord 3207: Title is \"Availability of Export Repository API\". The description talks about new APIs for exporting repositories. This is a new feature, so an event. The event name would be \"EXPORT REPOSITORY API AVAILABILITY — 2024-04-01\". The description mentions SAP Business Accelerator Hub, which is an organization. So, a relationship between the event and SAP BUSINESS ACCELERATOR HUB as the organization providing the API.\n\nRecord 3208: Updates to the offboarding process. This is a change, so an event. The event name is \"OFFBOARDING PROCESS UPDATES — 2024-04-01\". The description mentions using desktop clients, but no specific organizations or geos, so no relationships.\n\nRecord 3209: Software version update for Edge Integration Cell. This is a new version, so an event. The name would be \"EDGE INTEGRATION CELL VERSION UPDATE — 2024-03-29\". No organizations or geos mentioned, so no relationships.\n\nRecord 3210: Supported versions for Cloud Build Service. This is a change, so an event. The name is \"SUPPORTED VERSIONS FOR CLOUD BUILD SERVICE — 2024-03-29\". The description mentions SAP Asset Manager, which is an organization. So, a relationship between the event and SAP ASSET MANAGER.\n\nI need to make sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formed with strength between 1-10. Also, check that no invalid entities are included. Let me structure each entity and relationship accordingly.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>REBRANDING OF SAP MASTER DATA ORCHESTRATION — 2024-04-01<|>EVENT<|>SAP MASTER DATA ORCHESTRATION RENAMED TO BUSINESS DATA ORCHESTRATION<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>EXPORT REPOSITORY API AVAILABILITY — 2024-04-01<|>EVENT<|>NEW REST-BASED APIs FOR EXPORTING REPOSITORY METADATA AND STATUS<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BUSINESS ACCELERATOR HUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PLATFORM HOSTING NEW EXPORT REPOSITORY API<|>  \n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPORT REPOSITORY API AVAILABILITY — 2024-04-01<|>SAP BUSINESS ACCELERATOR HUB<|>API PUBLISHED ON THIS PLATFORM<|>8<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>OFFBOARDING PROCESS UPDATES — 2024-04-01<|>EVENT<|>UPDATED OFFBOARDING WORKFLOW FOR DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICE<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>EDGE INTEGRATION CELL VERSION UPDATE — 2024-03-29<|>EVENT<|>EDGE INTEGRATION CELL UPGRADED TO VERSION 8.14.*<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORTED VERSIONS FOR CLOUD BUILD SERVICE — 2024-03-29<|>EVENT<|>UPDATED SUPPORTED SDK AND OS VERSIONS FOR CLOUD BUILD SERVICE<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP ASSET MANAGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MOBILE SDK AND IOS/ANDROID VERSIONS UPDATED<|>  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPORTED VERSIONS FOR CLOUD BUILD SERVICE — 2024-03-29<|>SAP ASSET MANAGER<|>VERSION UPDATES INCLUDE THIS SERVICE<|>7<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926420, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 969, "prompt_tokens": 3364, "total_tokens": 4333, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.127581976724905, "duration": 30.161}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
