The following timeline outlines the steps we will take to phase out version v1beta1:  Kyma dashboard won't display APIRule CRs in version v1beta1. All APIRules v1beta1 will be fully operational from the command line, and you will still be able to manage them using kubectl. This change will not affect any pipelines that manage APIRules using Kubernetes utilities such as kubectl or helm.    Fast channel release date: August 18, 2025  Regular channel release date: September 1, 2025      You won't be able to create APIRule CRs v1beta1 in new clusters. In existing clusters, you will still be able to create and modify APIRule CRs v1beta1.  Fast channel release date: End of October, 2025  Regular channel release date: Mid-November, 2025    You won't be able to create APIRule CRs v1beta1 in new and existing clusters, modify existing APIRule CRs v1beta1, or delete them. All APIRule v1beta1 configurations set up prior to this restriction will remain active and continue to function as expected. The API Gateway module will manage and reconcile resources based on the existing APIRule settings.  Fast channel release date: Mid-November, 2025  Regular channel release date: End of the year 2025      Required action: Migrate all your APIRules to version v2. To learn how to do this, see APIRule Migration. We strongly recommend that you start the migration as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_853f80d6e07d0dd42e293673d1a7c8489d96d632ed5cbb9b0b63edac312b7ddc_v2"}
