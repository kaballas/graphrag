The user provided some SAP SuccessFactors release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the Line of Business here is Technology, and the instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, products/services aren't entities. But here, TECHNOLOGY is part of the Line of Business, but the entity types are still organization, person, geo, event. So I need to check each record.\n\nLooking at the first text: \"/pipeline/search to see a list of document grounding pipelines... Valid as Of: 2025-08-21.\" This seems like a new feature, so an EVENT. The title isn't given, but the description mentions \"Search Pipelines\" and \"document grounding pipelines.\" The event name should be something like \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING PIPELINE SEARCH — 2025-08-21\" with a description about the search functionality.\n\nNext, Record 18: \"Document Grounding Capability - Set Up Content Ingestion.\" The description talks about SharePoint folder depth and cronExpression scheduling. This is a change, so EVENT. The name could be \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING CONTENT INGESTION UPDATES — 2025-08-21\" with details on folder depth and scheduling.\n\nRecord 19: \"About Section available for Embedded Joule.\" This is a new feature, so EVENT. Name: \"ABOUT SECTION FOR EMBEDDED JOULE — 2025-08-19\" with the description about the added section and download traces.\n\nRecord 20: \"Document Attachment Feature for Task Completion in Joule.\" New feature, EVENT. Name: \"DOCUMENT ATTACHMENT FEATURE FOR TASK COMPLETION — 2025-08-19\" with the description about uploading files during tasks.\n\nNow, check for relationships. The events are all related to Joule, but Joule isn't an entity here because the entity types don't include technology. However, looking at the examples, sometimes the product is mentioned as part of the event description. But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, products aren't entities. Since the entity types here are organization, person, geo, event, and Joule is a product/service, it shouldn't be an entity. So no relationships between events and organizations unless mentioned. \n\nLooking for any organizations mentioned. The text mentions \"SharePoint\" in Record 18, but SharePoint is a product, not an organization. Microsoft Azure was in previous examples, but not here. So no organizations to link. GEOs? No locations mentioned. So no relationships. \n\nThus, the output will be four events with their descriptions, and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING PIPELINE SEARCH — 2025-08-21<|>EVENT<|>Search pipelines for document grounding based on metadata in request body per Search Pipelines guidance)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING CONTENT INGESTION UPDATES — 2025-08-21<|>EVENT<|>SharePoint folder depth limit increased to 5 levels; cronExpression supports scheduled pipeline triggers)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ABOUT SECTION FOR EMBEDDED JOULE — 2025-08-19<|>EVENT<|>Embedded Joule now includes About section with app/environment details and trace download capability)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT ATTACHMENT FEATURE FOR TASK COMPLETION — 2025-08-19<|>EVENT<|>Users can upload files directly within Joule during task/transaction workflows)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921450, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 819, "prompt_tokens": 2735, "total_tokens": 3554, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 35.99683544303797, "duration": 22.752}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
