The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" release notes based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the user mentioned that if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. But looking at the examples, even when the component is a technology-related service, they are treated as events.\n\nStarting with Record 877: Component is Feature Flags Service, Environment Cloud Foundry and Kyma. The title is \"Service Instance Sharing\". The description talks about sharing service instances between Cloud Foundry orgs. Since this is a new feature (Type: New), I should create an EVENT entity. The name would be \"SERVICE INSTANCE SHARING — 2025-05-15\" (using Valid as Of date). The description should mention sharing between orgs in the same subaccount.\n\nNext, Record 878: Component Kyma Runtime, Environment Kyma. Title is API Gateway module update to 3.0.3. This is a Changed type. So another EVENT entity: \"API GATEWAY MODULE UPDATE TO 3.0.3 — 2025-05-15\". Description includes fixes related to extAuth handler and APIRule reconciliation.\n\nRecord 879: Pricing Service in Cloud Foundry. Title mentions a fix for variant condition field. Type is Changed. EVENT entity: \"PRICING SERVICE FIX FOR VARIANT CONDITION FIELD — 2025-05-15\". Description about fixing discrepancies with back-end pricing.\n\nRecord 880: SAP BTP Cockpit, sorting org members. Type Changed. EVENT: \"SORTING ORG MEMBERS IN COCKPIT — 2025-05-15\". Description allows sorting by update date or email.\n\nNow, check for organizations. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry, Kyma, SAP BTP. These are organizations. So create entities for CLOUD FOUNDRY, KYMA, SAP BTP. Descriptions would be their roles as platforms.\n\nRelationships: Each event should relate to the relevant organization. For example, SERVICE INSTANCE SHARING event involves CLOUD FOUNDRY and KYMA. The API GATEWAY UPDATE relates to KYMA. PRICING SERVICE relates to CLOUD FOUNDRY. SORTING ORG MEMBERS relates to SAP BTP.\n\nNeed to ensure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are concise, and relationships are correctly linked with appropriate strength (probably 9 or 10 for direct involvement). Also, check that no invalid entities are included. No GEOs or PERSONs here, so only events and organizations.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE INSTANCE SHARING — 2025-05-15<|>EVENT<|>Share SAP Feature Flags service instances between Cloud Foundry orgs in same subaccount for main/extension landscapes)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>API GATEWAY MODULE UPDATE TO 3.0.3 — 2025-05-15<|>EVENT<|>Fix extAuth handler scoping, APIRule reconciliation, and v2 conversion annotation issues in Kyma API Gateway)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRICING SERVICE FIX FOR VARIANT CONDITION FIELD — 2025-05-15<|>EVENT<|>Correct discrepancy in variant condition key handling for access type A in Pricing Service)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SORTING ORG MEMBERS IN COCKPIT — 2025-05-15<|>EVENT<|>Add sorting by update date/email (ascending/descending) for Org Members in SAP BTP Cockpit)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud application platform for SAP BTP services)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KYMA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud-native application runtime for SAP BTP)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP's cloud platform for enterprise applications)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICE INSTANCE SHARING — 2025-05-15<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Event enables sharing across Cloud Foundry organizations<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICE INSTANCE SHARING — 2025-05-15<|>KYMA<|>Event supports Kyma environment sharing capabilities<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>API GATEWAY MODULE UPDATE TO 3.0.3 — 2025-05-15<|>KYMA<|>Event updates Kyma's API Gateway module<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PRICING SERVICE FIX FOR VARIANT CONDITION FIELD — 2025-05-15<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Event applies to Cloud Foundry Pricing Service<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SORTING ORG MEMBERS IN COCKPIT — 2025-05-15<|>SAP BTP<|>Event enhances SAP BTP Cockpit functionality<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926965, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1164, "prompt_tokens": 3294, "total_tokens": 4458, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.891284692731304, "duration": 36.499}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
