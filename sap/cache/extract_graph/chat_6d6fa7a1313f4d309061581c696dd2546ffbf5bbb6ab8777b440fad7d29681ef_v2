The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, looking at the first part of the text: \"Public Information from Knowledge-Based Articles are now integrated into SAP Joule for Consultants.\" The key here is \"SAP Joule\" and the integration of knowledge-based articles. Since \"SAP Joule\" is a product, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, we shouldn't emit products as entities. Wait, the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. So products like SAP Joule aren't allowed as entities unless they're part of an event. But the instruction says if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, then represent changes as EVENT entities. Wait, the user's entity types include EVENT, so maybe I can create an event here.\n\nThe text mentions \"Public Information... integrated into SAP Joule for Consultants.\" This sounds like a new feature or enhancement, so an EVENT. The valid as of date is 2025-08-29. The event name could be \"INTEGRATION OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED ARTICLES INTO SAP JOULE — 2025-08-29\". The description would be \"Integration of public knowledge-based articles into SAP Joule for consultants; refreshed content from SAP Learning, Community, and Roadmap.\"\n\nNext, the second record: \"Updated Deploying and Delivering Applications\" under SAP BTP Administrator's Guide. The environment is Cloud Foundry, but the entity types don't include technology. So this is an announcement, which is an EVENT. The event name would be \"UPDATED DEPLOYING AND DELIVERING APPLICATIONS — 2025-08-28\". Description: \"Updated recommendations for deploying and delivering applications in SAP BTP environments.\"\n\nThird record: \"Moving to the SAP Build service plan\" with several services upgrading. This is a new feature (Type: New), so an EVENT. The name could be \"SAP BUILD SERVICE PLAN UPGRADE — 2025-08-28\". Description: \"Several services can now upgrade to SAP Build plan, including SAP Mobile Services, Document Management, etc.\"\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The first event involves SAP JOULE, but since SAP Joule is a product and not an organization, maybe there's no organization here. The second event mentions SAP BTP Administrator's Guide, but again, that's a document, not an organization. The third event lists services like SAP Mobile Services, which are products. However, the entity types don't include technology, so these products aren't entities. Therefore, no relationships to emit.\n\nWait, but in the examples, sometimes the organization is mentioned. For instance, in Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. Here, the environments like Cloud Foundry are part of SAP BTP, but the user's entity types don't include technology. So maybe no organizations are present here. The only possible organization might be SAP, but the text doesn't explicitly mention \"SAP\" as an organization in these records. The components are SAP BTP Administrator's Guide, SAP Build, etc., but those are products or services, not organizations. So no organizations to extract.\n\nGEO isn't mentioned in any of the texts. PERSON isn't mentioned either. So the only entities are the events. No relationships since there's no clear dependency between events and other entities.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATION OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED ARTICLES INTO SAP JOULE — 2025-08-29<|>EVENT<|>Integration of public knowledge-based articles into SAP Joule for consultants; refreshed content from SAP Learning, Community, and Roadmap)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>UPDATED DEPLOYING AND DELIVERING APPLICATIONS — 2025-08-28<|>EVENT<|>Updated recommendations for deploying and delivering applications in SAP BTP environments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BUILD SERVICE PLAN UPGRADE — 2025-08-28<|>EVENT<|>Several services can now upgrade to SAP Build plan, including SAP Mobile Services, Document Management, etc.)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926207, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 908, "prompt_tokens": 3020, "total_tokens": 3928, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.588102278657157, "duration": 28.745}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
