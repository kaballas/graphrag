The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP release notes based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to go through each record and identify the events, organizations, and geos.\n\nStarting with Record 101: Joule is now available in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. The event name should be \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-10-14\" since that's the Valid as Of date. The description mentions navigational use cases and SAP Fiori apps. SAP S/4HANA is a product, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity, I need to represent this as an EVENT. SAP BTP might be an organization, but the text doesn't mention it here. Wait, the component is Joule, environment is Cloud Foundry, but the title is about availability in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. So the event is the availability, and the organization might be SAP, but the example D used Microsoft Azure as the organization. However, the text here doesn't explicitly name an organization, just the product. Hmm, maybe no organization here. But the example C didn't have an organization either. So maybe just the event.\n\nRecord 102: New use cases for Finance in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. The event name would be \"NEW USE CASES FOR FINANCE IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-10-14\". Description includes display G/L account balances and line items. Again, no organization mentioned, so just the event.\n\nRecord 103: New use cases for Procurement in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Event name: \"NEW USE CASES FOR PROCUREMENT IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-10-14\". Description about purchase orders and requisitions. Same as above, no organization.\n\nRecord 104: New use cases in Cross Area Capabilities for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Event name: \"NEW USE CASES IN CROSS AREA CAPABILITIES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-10-14\". Description lists various business partner details. Again, event only.\n\nRecord 105: Joule available in Japan (Tokyo) data center of AWS. Event name: \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN JAPAN (TOKYO) DATA CENTER — 2024-10-03\". Description mentions AWS. So here, AWS is an organization, and Tokyo, Japan is a geo. The event is the availability in that data center. So entities would be the event, AWS (ORGANIZATION), and JAPAN (TOKYO) (GEO). Relationships: event involves AWS and occurs in Tokyo.\n\nRecord 106: Document grounding capability available. Event name: \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY AVAILABILITY — 2024-09-30\". Description about adding context via documents. No organization or geo, so just the event.\n\nRecord 107: Joule consumption across data centers. The event name would be \"JOULE CONSUMPTION ACROSS DATA CENTERS — 2024-09-20\". Description mentions data center mapping removal. No organization or geo here, so just the event.\n\nRecord 108: Support for cookies partitioning. Event name: \"SUPPORT FOR COOKIES PARTITIONING — 2024-09-20\". Description about mitigating third-party cookies. No entities here, just the event.\n\nRecord 109: Joule Booster update. Event name: \"JOULE BOOSTER UPDATE — 2024-09-20\". Description about creating formations in SAP BTP. SAP BTP is an organization. So entities: event and SAP BTP (ORGANIZATION). Relationship: event involves SAP BTP.\n\nNow, checking each entity against the rules. Ensure that only allowed types are used. For example, in Record 105, AWS is an organization, Tokyo is a geo. In Record 109, SAP BTP is an organization. All other events are correctly named with the date. Descriptions are under 25 words. Relationships are between events and organizations/geos with appropriate strength. Need to make sure no products are emitted as entities unless they're part of an organization. Also, check that all entity names are uppercase and types are correct.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-10-14<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports navigational use cases in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition via SAP Fiori apps)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES FOR FINANCE IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-10-14<|>EVENT<|>Finance module now supports displaying G/L account balances and line items in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES FOR PROCUREMENT IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-10-14<|>EVENT<|>Procurement module now supports fetching purchase order and requisition details in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN CROSS AREA CAPABILITIES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-10-14<|>EVENT<|>Cross-area capabilities now support displaying business partner data in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN JAPAN (TOKYO) DATA CENTER — 2024-10-03<|>EVENT<|>Joule is now available in AWS's Japan (Tokyo) data center)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing data center infrastructure for Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN (TOKYO)<|>GEO<|>Data center location for AWS where Joule is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY AVAILABILITY — 2024-09-30<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports document grounding for integrations via uploaded documents)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE CONSUMPTION ACROSS DATA CENTERS — 2024-09-20<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports cross-data center consumption with removed mapping between Joule and SAP SuccessFactors)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORT FOR COOKIES PARTITIONING — 2024-09-20<|>EVENT<|>Joule supports cookie partitioning to mitigate third-party cookie deprecation impacts)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE BOOSTER UPDATE — 2024-09-20<|>EVENT<|>Joule booster creates formations in SAP BTP for integration with selected systems)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform where Joule formations are created via the Joule booster)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN JAPAN (TOKYO) DATA CENTER — 2024-10-03<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN JAPAN (TOKYO) DATA CENTER — 2024-10-03<|>JAPAN (TOKYO)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE BOOSTER UPDATE — 2024-09-20<|>SAP BTP<|>Event involves organization's platform<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921286, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1785, "prompt_tokens": 3560, "total_tokens": 5345, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 36.34327598493332, "duration": 49.115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
