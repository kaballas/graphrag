Now, Kyma dashboard does not display APIRule custom resources (CRs) in version v1beta1. All APIRules v1beta1 are fully operational from the command line, and you are still be able to manage them using kubectl. Additionally, this change does not affect any pipelines that manage APIRules using Kubernetes utilities such as kubectl or helm.  Required action: You must migrate all your APIRules to version v2. For more information, see APIRule Migration. We strongly recommend that you start the migration as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions. For the complete deletion timeline, see APIRule Migration Timeline.  This release also brings the following improvements:  We've fixed conversion from APIRule v1beta1 to v2. The conversion now sets all convertible fields in the APIRule's spec. See issue #1983.    We've fixed a bug where APIRules v2alpha1 and v2 were set to the Error state when the target workload was in the mesh with the Istio proxy running in native sidecar mode. See #2100.      We've fixed a bug that caused AuthorizationPolicy creation to fail for APIRules in namespaces with names longer than 36 characters. Now, namespace names up to 63 characters are supported.    \";\"Required\";\"Deleted\";\"Changed\";\"Technology\";\"2025-08-19\";\"2025-09-01\";\"Cloud\"\n\"Cloud Integration\";\"Cloud Foundry\";\"BigCommerce Receiver Adapter Available\";\"BigCommerce receiver adapter is available now.
