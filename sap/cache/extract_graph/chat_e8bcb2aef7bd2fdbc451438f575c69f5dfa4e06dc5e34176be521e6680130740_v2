The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the user mentioned that if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, products/services should be represented as events. But looking at the examples, the main focus here is on the changes and new features, which are events.\n\nStarting with Record 4031: It's about limits for Application Security Descriptor and Service Broker Bindings. This seems like a change, so an event. The title can be formatted as \"LIMITS FOR APPLICATION SECURITY DESCRIPTOR AND SERVICE BROKER BINDINGS — 2023-10-19\". The description would mention the limits on properties and service broker bindings.\n\nRecord 4032 introduces sorting in SAP BTP Cockpit. That's a new feature, so an event. The title would be \"SORTING NOW AVAILABLE IN ACCOUNT EXPLORER OF SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19\". The description includes the alphabetical sort option and hierarchy preservation.\n\nRecord 4033 is about removing outdated SAPUI5 versions. This is an announcement, so an event. Title: \"NOTIFICATION OF REMOVING OUTDATED SAPUI5 VERSIONS FROM CDM — 2023-10-19\". Description mentions the removal and reference to SAP Note 3001696.\n\nRecord 4034 allows extending service binding validity. New feature, so event. Title: \"BINDING VALIDITY MANAGEMENT — 2023-10-19\". Description about extending validity by 3 days.\n\nRecord 4035 has enhancements in Data Quality Services. The country name change and address validations. This is an announcement, so event. Title: \"ENHANCEMENTS TO DATA QUALITY SERVICES — 2023-10-19\". Description includes updates to Turkey's name, Denmark's address validation, Argentina's postcodes, and Israel's address standardization.\n\nRecord 4036 introduces new events in SAP Alert Notification Service. New feature, event. Title: \"NEW SAP CREDENTIAL STORE EVENTS — 2023-10-19\". Description mentions the two new events.\n\nRecord 4037 enables Horizon Theme in SAP BTP Cockpit. New feature, event. Title: \"ENABLING HORIZON THEME IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19\". Description about the themes and accessibility options.\n\nRecord 4038 introduces a new global URL for SAP BTP Cockpit. This is a new feature, so event. Title: \"NEW GLOBAL URL FOR SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19\". Description about the URL and regional redirection.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. However, in these records, most events are about features or changes within SAP services, which might not directly link to organizations or geos unless specified. For example, if an event mentions a specific data center (like Sydney, Australia), that would be a geo. But in these records, I don't see any explicit mentions of organizations or geos beyond the SAP products. \n\nLooking at Record 4038, the URL mentions regions like EMEA, AMER, APAC. These are geos. So, the event \"NEW GLOBAL URL FOR SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19\" would have relationships with EMEA, AMER, APAC as geos. The relationship description would be \"Event involves regional URLs\" with strength 7.\n\nOther records don't mention specific organizations or geos, so no relationships there. The SAP BTP Cockpit and other components are part of SAP's services, but since the entity types don't include products/services unless they're events, and the user's examples don't include them as entities, I shouldn't list them as organizations. \n\nSo, the final output will have the events and the one relationship from Record 4038.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>LIMITS FOR APPLICATION SECURITY DESCRIPTOR AND SERVICE BROKER BINDINGS — 2023-10-19<|>EVENT<|>Limits on application security descriptor properties and service broker bindings (or service keys) defined for SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SORTING NOW AVAILABLE IN ACCOUNT EXPLORER OF SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19<|>EVENT<|>Alphabetical sorting added for all columns in SAP BTP Cockpit Account Explorer, preserving account hierarchy)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NOTIFICATION OF REMOVING OUTDATED SAPUI5 VERSIONS FROM CDM — 2023-10-19<|>EVENT<|>Outdated SAPUI5 versions removed from CDN; see SAP Note 3001696 for details)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BINDING VALIDITY MANAGEMENT — 2023-10-19<|>EVENT<|>Service bindings validity can now be extended by up to 3 days)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO DATA QUALITY SERVICES — 2023-10-19<|>EVENT<|>Turkey renamed to Türkiye; Denmark address validation added; Argentina postcodes updated; Israel address standardization improved)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW SAP CREDENTIAL STORE EVENTS — 2023-10-19<|>EVENT<|>Number Of Credentials Threshold Reached and Used Storage In MB Threshold Reached events now supported)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENABLING HORIZON THEME IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19<|>EVENT<|>Horizon theme (Morning/Evening/High-Contrast) added to SAP BTP Cockpit for Neo and Cloud Foundry)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW GLOBAL URL FOR SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19<|>EVENT<|>Global URL https://cockpit.btp.cloud.sap redirects to regional URLs (EMEA/AMER/APAC) based on user location)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW GLOBAL URL FOR SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19<|>EMEA<|>Event involves regional URL redirection<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW GLOBAL URL FOR SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19<|>AMER<|>Event involves regional URL redirection<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW GLOBAL URL FOR SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2023-10-19<|>APAC<|>Event involves regional URL redirection<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926802, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1545, "prompt_tokens": 3921, "total_tokens": 5466, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.58462511863335, "duration": 47.415}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
