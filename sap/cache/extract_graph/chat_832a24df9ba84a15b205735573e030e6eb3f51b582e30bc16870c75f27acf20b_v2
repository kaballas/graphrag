The task is to identify all entities and relationships among them. The text is about a hostage exchange between Firuzabad and Aurelia, with Quintara acting as the broker. The entities are the countries, people, and organizations involved, and the relationships are based on the text. The relationships are scored based on the strength of the connection, with 1 being the lowest and 10 the highest. \n\nThe text is about a hostage exchange involving multiple entities. Let's break down the text to identify entities and relationships. The text mentions \"Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.\" So, the entities are the countries, people, and organizations involved in the exchange. The relationships are between the entities, such as the exchange of hostages, the location of the prison, and the officials welcoming the Aurelians. \n\nThe text is about a hostage exchange between Firuzabad and Aurelia, with Quintara acting as the broker.

To achieve this we already switched from daily indexes to the index rollover approach (see previous announcement from 17. April 2025 for non OpenTelemetry workload indexes.This announcement deals with OpenTelemetry logs and metrics indexes (logs-otel-v1-, metrics-otel-v1-) targeting the release date - 29./30. October 2025.   With this change OpenTelemetry logs and metrics index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you are using the OpenTelemetry logs/metrics feature and rely on the old index suffix on your custom OpenSearch content / queries. In such cases you need to adapt:  Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.    If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern (e.g. metrics-otel-v1-*) instead of targeting individual indexes.      Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC).
