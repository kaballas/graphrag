The user provided a set of records from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. Since the user mentioned that if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. Looking at the records, most of them are about new features, updates, or changes in various SAP components, so they should be considered events.\n\nStarting with Record 3371: The title is \"Base Theming Content for CF and Neo.\" The valid as of date is 2024-02-28. This seems like an event. The entity name would be \"BASE THEMING CONTENT UPDATE — 2024-02-28\" with the description mentioning the version update and the GitHub link. \n\nNext, Record 3372: \"Theme Preview as Cards\" with the same valid date. Another event, so \"THEME PREVIEW AS CARDS — 2024-02-28\" with the description about the welcome page showing cards.\n\nRecord 3373: Telemetry module update to 1.9.0. Valid as of 2024-02-27. Event name: \"TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE TO 1.9.0 — 2024-02-27\". Description includes the improvements in logs, traces, and metrics.\n\nRecord 3374: Features for Version 2024.5 of SAP Datasphere. Valid as of 2024-02-27. Event name: \"SAP DATASPHHERE 2024.5 FEATURES — 2024-02-27\". Description mentions new and changed features for administration and SAP BW bridge.\n\nRecord 3375: Connectivity Proxy for Kubernetes announcement. Valid as of 2024-02-26. This is a significant change, so event name: \"CONNECTIVITY PROXY MIGRATION TO MODULE — 2024-02-26\". Description includes the conversion to a third-party module, automated migration, and downtime details.\n\nRecord 3376: Customer-Managed Keys for SAP Forms service. Valid as of 2024-02-26. Event name: \"CUSTOMER-MANAGED KEYS FOR SAP FORMS — 2024-02-26\". Description about encrypting data with CMK by default.\n\nRecord 3377: NATS module update to 1.1.0. Valid as of 2024-02-26. Event name: \"NATS MODULE UPDATE TO 1.1.0 — 2024-02-26\". Description lists the component upgrades.\n\nRecord 3378: Reuse UI pagination deprecated. Valid as of 2024-02-23. This is a deprecation, so event name: \"REUSE UI PAGINATION DEPRECATION — 2024-02-23\". Description mentions deprecation and the need to use supported configurations.\n\nRecord 3379: Integrating SAP S/4HANA with Google Workspace using Document Management Service. The description is empty, so maybe not enough info. But the title mentions integration, so perhaps an event. However, without a valid date or more details, it might be excluded. Wait, the valid as of date is missing here. The user's examples included \"Valid as Of\" dates, so if this record doesn't have one, maybe it's not an event. The user's instruction says to use \"Valid as Of\" if present, else \"Latest Revision\". But in this case, the record doesn't have a valid as of date, and the latest revision is 2024-02-23. However, the description is empty, so maybe it's not a valid event. I'll skip this one.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations, geos, etc. For instance, if an event involves a specific organization or location. Looking at the events:\n\n- The Connectivity Proxy migration involves Kyma Runtime (which is an environment, but the entity types don't include environments. Wait, the user said if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities. But in the examples, like Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So, in the records, environments like Cloud Foundry, Kyma, Neo are part of the Environment field. However, the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. So, environments like Cloud Foundry are not organizations unless explicitly mentioned as such. The user's instruction says not to emit products/services/environments as entities unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. For example, in Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So, in the records, if the environment is Cloud Foundry, which is a product, but not an organization, so we shouldn't emit it as an entity. However, if the text mentions an organization like SAP, then that's allowed.\n\nLooking at the events, none of them mention specific organizations beyond what's in the component names. For example, \"SAP Datasphere\" is a product, not an organization. So, no relationships to organizations or geos. Therefore, there are no relationships to emit here.\n\nSo, the final output will be the list of events without any relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>BASE THEMING CONTENT UPDATE — 2024-02-28<|>EVENT<|>Base theming content updated to version 11.12.1 for Cloud Foundry and Neo environments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>THEME PREVIEW AS CARDS — 2024-02-28<|>EVENT<|>UI Theme Designer welcome page displays theme previews as cards with list view option)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE TO 1.9.0 — 2024-02-27<|>EVENT<|>Kyma Runtime telemetry module upgraded with log filtering and OTel Collector improvements)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP DATASPHHERE 2024.5 FEATURES — 2024-02-27<|>EVENT<|>SAP Datasphere 2024.5 introduces administration and SAP BW bridge enhancements)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CONNECTIVITY PROXY MIGRATION TO MODULE — 2024-02-26<|>EVENT<|>Kyma Connectivity Proxy converted to third-party module with automated migration)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER-MANAGED KEYS FOR SAP FORMS — 2024-02-26<|>EVENT<|>SAP Forms service encrypts template store data with customer-managed keys by default)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NATS MODULE UPDATE TO 1.1.0 — 2024-02-26<|>EVENT<|>Kyma Runtime NATS module upgraded with nats-server and exporter version updates)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REUSE UI PAGINATION DEPRECATION — 2024-02-23<|>EVENT<|>Document Management Service deprecates pagination configuration in Reuse UI)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923261, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1636, "prompt_tokens": 3946, "total_tokens": 5582, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.802662710029274, "duration": 49.874}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

All existing instances of the Connectivity Proxy must be converted to the new module-based solution. The migration is automated and happens upon enabling the Connectivity Proxy module. After the migration, the Connectivity Proxy will be consumable in the same way as before.   The migration has two stages.   As of March 2, 2024, the module will be available via the 'fast' channel. All customers can then enable it and make the switch (it will also be available for new installations).   Then, on March 16, 2024, during a maintenance window, all remaining connectivity proxies provisioned via the old approach will automatically be migrated to the module by SAP.   While the migration results in a backward-compatible deployment of the Connectivity Proxy, the process involves a downtime of around 2 minutes (depending on cluster load and other factors).   In case of questions or issues, please raise a support ticket on the BC-CP-CON-K8S-PROXY component.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-01\nValid as Of: 2024-02-26\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3376 ---\nComponent: Forms Service by Adobe\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Customer-Managed Keys\nDescription: The SAP Forms service now provides the following new feature:If you are a new subscriber to the SAP Forms service, your template store data (templates, schemas), credentials, certificates, certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and passwords are encrypted by the customer-managed keys (CMK) feature by default.For more information, see Customer-Managed Keys.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-01\nValid as Of: 2024-02-26\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3377 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: NATS module: Update to version 1.1.0\nDescription: The new version brings the following improvements:      nats-server upgrade to version 2.10.7      prometheus-nats-exporter upgrade to version 0.14.0      nats-config-reloader upgrade to version 0.14.1    \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-02-26\nValid as Of: 2024-02-26\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3378 ---\nComponent: Document Management Service\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Update - Reuse UI\nDescription: The pagination configuration for the Reuse UI has been deprecated and is no longer available.
