The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the user mentioned that if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. Looking at the records, most of them are under \"Technology\" line of business, so they should be considered as events.\n\nStarting with Record 4141: \"Define Custom Variables for Your Process\" under SAP Build Process Automation. This is a new feature or change, so it's an EVENT. The name would be \"DEFINE CUSTOM VARIABLES FOR YOUR PROCESS — 2023-09-28\" with a description about global variables in processes.\n\nRecord 4142: \"Input Validation in Forms\" is another change, so another EVENT. The description mentions configuring input validation in forms.\n\nRecord 4143: This is about deprecating an interface. The action is \"Required\" and lifecycle is \"Deprecated\". The event name would be \"DEPRECATION OF XSUSERINFO INTERFACE — 2023-09-27\" with a description about the deprecation and replacement.\n\nRecord 4144: \"Corporate IdP\" is a new feature, so EVENT. The description talks about adding a parameter for corporate identity providers.\n\nRecord 4145: \"Regular Upgrade\" for Identity Authentication. This is an EVENT with a description about the upgrade.\n\nRecord 4146: \"Directory Enhancements\" is a new feature, so EVENT. The description details enhancements in managing directories.\n\nRecord 4147: The title is cut off (\"Enh\"), so maybe it's incomplete. Since there's no valid data, I'll skip it.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. However, in these records, there's no mention of specific organizations, people, or geos beyond the product names. Since the instructions say not to emit products/services as entities unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed, but here the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The products like SAP Build Process Automation are part of the event descriptions but not entities themselves. So, no relationships to emit here.\n\nEach event is standalone without clear dependencies on other entities. Therefore, the output will have the events and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFINE CUSTOM VARIABLES FOR YOUR PROCESS — 2023-09-28<|>EVENT<|>Define global process variables for input in conditional branches)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INPUT VALIDATION IN FORMS — 2023-09-28<|>EVENT<|>Configure text field validation in form editors for data integrity)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DEPRECATION OF XSUSERINFO INTERFACE — 2023-09-27<|>EVENT<|>Deprecated XSUserInfo interface replaced by UserData in xs-user-holder)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE IDP SUPPORT — 2023-09-27<|>EVENT<|>Added idp parameter for corporate identity provider sign-in configuration)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION UPGRADE — 2023-09-27<|>EVENT<|>Identity Authentication component upgraded to latest version)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTORY ENTITLEMENT MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS — 2023-09-27<|>EVENT<|>Enable entitlement/user management during directory creation/editing)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925488, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 796, "prompt_tokens": 3913, "total_tokens": 4709, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.876977293660648, "duration": 24.971}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.

Interface com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo was deprecated and later removed with version 3.0.0 of cloud-security-services-integration-library. For more information, see: SAP BTP Security Services Integration Libraries: v 3.0.0  This interface is replaced by a new one – com.sap.xs.security.UserData. It's introduced with version 1.47.0 of xs-user-holder.   If your pom.xml file contains the following <dependency>, that means your project uses xs-user-holder and needs to be adapted:   <dependency>\n    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sjb</groupId>\n    <artifactId>xs-user-holder</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n  The xs-user-holder component currently provides getter and setter methods for working with the deprecated com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo.   Action: If your code uses these methods, make the following modifications:      Replace UserInfoHolder.getUserInfo() with UserInfoHolder.getUserData()      Replace UserInfoHolder.setUserInfo(XSUserInfo userInfo) with UserInfoHolder.setUserData(UserData userData)      Note      The same token information that XSUserInfo provides can be obtained with the new UserData interface.      Getter and setter methods for the deprecated com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo will remain available in the xs-user-holder component, and will coexist with the methods from com.sap.xs.security.UserData till December 31, 2023.      When this period is over, everything based on the deprecated code from package com.sap.xsa.security.container will be removed, and only the new UserData interface will be supported in the xs-user-holder component.    \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2023-09-15\nValid as Of: 2023-09-27\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 4144 ---\nComponent: Cloud Identity Services\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo\nTitle: Corporate IdP\nDescription: Identity Authentication added new parameter idp which allows sign in to specific application with specific corporate identity provider.

Previously, enabling the entitlement and user management features for a directory was only possible after the directory was created, from the directory's Users and Entitlements pages.   Now, we've made it easier for you to enable these features right from the start when you create a directory, or when editing a directory from the Account Explorer page.  Furthermore, we've added the ability to enable the entitlement management feature for any directory directly on the global account's Entitlements  Entity Entitlements page. Until now, this page did not allow you to select directories that weren't enabled to manage entitlements. Now, these directories can be selected.
