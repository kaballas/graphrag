The user provided a text from the SAP \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the text. The main content here is about a bug fix in the Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes. The description mentions fixing issues with SAP BTP destinations of type TCP and upgrading dependencies to fix Golang vulnerabilities. \n\nLooking at the steps, I need to create EVENT entities for releases, fixes, etc. The title is \"Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes - Bug Fixes\", and the valid as of date is 2024-09-05. So the event name should be \"TRANSPARENT PROXY FOR KUBERNETES BUG FIXES — 2024-09-05\". The description would mention the bug fixes related to SAP BTP TCP destinations and the dependency upgrades.\n\nNext, check for organizations. The text mentions SAP BTP, which is an organization. Also, Kyma and Cloud Foundry are environments, but since the entity types don't include technology, they shouldn't be emitted as entities. However, the user's examples sometimes include environments as part of the event description but not as separate entities unless they are organizations. \n\nWait, the instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities. But in this case, the entity types include organization, so SAP BTP is an organization. Kyma and Cloud Foundry are environments, but they might not be organizations. The user's example D included Microsoft Azure as an organization. So SAP BTP is an organization here.\n\nGEO isn't mentioned, so no geo entities. No person names, so no person entities. \n\nFor relationships, the event (Transparent Proxy bug fixes) involves SAP BTP as the organization providing the service. So the relationship would be the event involving SAP BTP. The strength could be around 8 or 9 since it's a bug fix related to their service.\n\nNow, check the validation rules. Make sure entity names are uppercase, types are correct, descriptions are under 25 words. The event description should be concise. \n\nPutting it all together: one event entity and a relationship between the event and SAP BTP as the organization.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSPARENT PROXY FOR KUBERNETES BUG FIXES — 2024-09-05<|>EVENT<|>Bug fixes for SAP BTP TCP destination address parsing and Golang dependency upgrades in Transparent Proxy 1.6.0)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing destination management and Kubernetes services)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSPARENT PROXY FOR KUBERNETES BUG FIXES — 2024-09-05<|>SAP BTP<|>Event addresses bug fixes for SAP BTP TCP destinations<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925953, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 647, "prompt_tokens": 2852, "total_tokens": 3499, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.71311558297098, "duration": 19.778}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
