The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. Since the entity types don't include technology, any product or service mentioned should be part of an event, not as separate entities. \n\nLooking at Record 2081: It's about new features in SAP Datasphere 2024.22. The event name would be \"FEATURES FOR VERSION 2024.22 — 2024-10-22\" with a description mentioning administration, data integration, etc. SAP DATASPHHERE is a product, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity, it's part of the event description.\n\nRecord 2082: Extracted Line Items in SAP Document AI. Event name \"EXTRACTED LINE ITEMS — 2024-10-22\" with the description about extracting globalTradeItemNumber. SAP DOCUMENT AI is part of the event, not an entity.\n\nRecord 2083: Improved ML models for documents. Event name \"NEW IMPROVED ML MODELS FOR INVOICE, PURCHASE ORDER, AND PAYMENT ADVICE — 2024-10-22\". The description mentions the document types and the improvement.\n\nRecord 2084: New Schema API endpoint. Event name \"NEW SCHEMA API ENDPOINT - UPDATE SCHEMA VERSION — 2024-10-22\" with the description about updating schema versions.\n\nRecord 2085: New Java runtime in Neo. Event name \"NEW RUNTIME FOR JAVA APPLICATIONS — 2024-10-21\" with details about Java Web Tomcat 10 Beta. SAP BTP is mentioned but not as an entity.\n\nRecord 2086: SAP Build Apps changes. Event name \"WEB & MOBILE — 2024-10-21\" covering the integration improvements and history tab features.\n\nRecord 2087: Deprecation of SAP Mobile Cards integration. Event name \"DEPRECATION OF THE INTEGRATION WITH SAP MOBILE CARDS APP — 2024-10-21\" with the description about deprecation and switching to SAP Build Work Zone.\n\nRecord 2088: Deprecation of SAP Event Mesh for credit integration. Event name \"DEPRECATION OF INTEGRATION USING SAP EVENT MESH — 2024-10-21\" with details on using OAuth 2.0 instead.\n\nRecord 2089: Transition to SAP Build Process Automation. Event name \"TRANSITION TO SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION — 2024-10-21\" with the reason being deprecation of instance-secrets.\n\nNow, check for relationships. Since most events are about features or deprecations without specific organizations, geos, or people, there might be no relationships. However, in Record 2087, SAP MOBILE CARDS APP is mentioned, but since it's a product and TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, it's part of the event description. Similarly, SAP BUILD WORK ZONE ADVANCED is part of the event. No clear relationships between events and other entities. So, no relationships to emit.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURES FOR VERSION 2024.22 — 2024-10-22<|>EVENT<|>New and changed features for administration, data integration, and data privacy/protection in SAP Datasphere 2024.22)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EXTRACTED LINE ITEMS — 2024-10-22<|>EVENT<|>Extract line item globalTradeItemNumber from purchaseOrder documents in SAP Document AI)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW IMPROVED ML MODELS FOR INVOICE, PURCHASE ORDER, AND PAYMENT ADVICE — 2024-10-22<|>EVENT<|>Enhanced machine learning models for invoice, purchase order, and payment advice document processing)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW SCHEMA API ENDPOINT - UPDATE SCHEMA VERSION — 2024-10-22<|>EVENT<|>Update schema version descriptions via new Schema API endpoint in SAP Document AI)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW RUNTIME FOR JAVA APPLICATIONS — 2024-10-21<|>EVENT<|>Java Web Tomcat 10 (Beta) runtime available for Neo environment with SAP BTP services client APIs)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>WEB & MOBILE — 2024-10-21<|>EVENT<|>Improved BTP destination integration, action library access, and app state history in SAP Build Apps)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DEPRECATION OF THE INTEGRATION WITH SAP MOBILE CARDS APP — 2024-10-21<|>EVENT<|>Deprecated SAP Mobile Cards integration; switch to SAP Build Work Zone Advanced mobile app)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DEPRECATION OF INTEGRATION USING SAP EVENT MESH — 2024-10-21<|>EVENT<|>Deprecated SAP Event Mesh for credit integration; use OAuth 2.0 or contact support for alternatives)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSITION TO SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION — 2024-10-21<|>EVENT<|>Updated transition guide due to deprecation of instance-secrets in Workflow Capability)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926331, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1230, "prompt_tokens": 3942, "total_tokens": 5172, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.39484842898154, "duration": 37.969}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
