The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the user mentioned that if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. Looking at the records, most entries are about new features, updates, or changes in SAP services, which should be events.\n\nStarting with Record 2161: It's about collecting data and performance metrics using FESR and transferring to SAP Cloud ALM. The key entities here are the event name and SAP CLOUD ALM as an organization. The event title would be something like \"COLLECTING DATA AND PERFORMANCE METRICS — 2024-10-07\" since the Valid as Of date is 2024-10-07. SAP CLOUD ALM is an organization.\n\nRecord 2162: Data Space Integration is available. The event name would be \"DATA SPACE INTEGRATION AVAILABILITY — 2024-10-05\". The organization here is SAP INTEGRATION SUITE, as it's mentioned as the capability provider.\n\nRecord 2163: Software version update for Data Space Integration. The event name would be \"DATA SPACE INTEGRATION SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2024-10-05\". The organization is again SAP INTEGRATION SUITE.\n\nRecord 2164: Use artifacts from dependent projects in SAP Build Process Automation. The event name is \"USE ARTIFACTS OF A DEPENDENT PROJECT — 2024-10-04\". The organization here is SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION.\n\nRecord 2165: Service name change from SAP Event Broker to SAP Cloud Application Event Hub. The event name is \"SERVICE NAME CHANGE TO SAP CLOUD APPLICATION EVENT HUB — 2024-10-04\". The organization is SAP CLOUD APPLICATION EVENT HUB.\n\nRecord 2166: Support for SAP CAP application as a consumer. Event name: \"SAP CAP APPLICATION SUPPORT AS CONSUMER — 2024-10-04\". Organization: SAP CLOUD APPLICATION EVENT HUB.\n\nRecord 2167: Removal of Security Recommendation BTP-UAA-0009. Event name: \"REMOVAL OF SECURITY RECOMMENDATION BTP-UAA-0009 — 2024-10-03\". Organization: AUTHORIZATION AND TRUST MANAGEMENT SERVICE.\n\nRecord 2168: New SAP Automation Pilot events. Event name: \"NEW SAP AUTOMATION PILOT EVENTS — 2024-10-03\". Organization: SAP AUTOMATION PILOT.\n\nRecord 2169: New cost breakdown charts in SAP BTP Cockpit. Event name: \"NEW COST BREAKDOWN CHARTS IN COSTS AND USAGE PAGE — 2024-10-03\". Organization: SAP BTP COCKPIT.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. For each event, I need to see if there's a connection to an organization or geo. For example, the event in Record 2161 involves SAP CLOUD ALM as the organization. So the relationship would be the event involving the organization. Similarly, the service name change in 2165 links the event to the new organization name. \n\nI need to ensure that all entity names are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. Also, relationships should be between the event and the organization, with a strength between 1-10. \n\nI should avoid any products/services that aren't explicitly mentioned as organizations. For example, \"SAP BTP Cockpit\" is part of the event name but might be considered an organization here. \n\nDouble-checking each record to make sure I didn't miss any events and that all entities are correctly categorized. Also, ensuring that the dates used are the \"Valid as Of\" dates where available, defaulting to \"Latest Revision\" if not. \n\nFinally, compiling all entities and relationships in the required format, separated by ## and ending with <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>COLLECTING DATA AND PERFORMANCE METRICS — 2024-10-07<|>EVENT<|>Performance metrics collected via FESR and transferred to SAP Cloud ALM for cloud reporting)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP CLOUD ALM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Service receiving performance artifacts from FESR tool)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DATA SPACE INTEGRATION AVAILABILITY — 2024-10-05<|>EVENT<|>Data Space Integration now available as SAP Integration Suite capability)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP INTEGRATION SUITE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platform providing Data Space Integration capability)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DATA SPACE INTEGRATION SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2024-10-05<|>EVENT<|>Updated versions for Data Space Integration and related components)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>USE ARTIFACTS OF A DEPENDENT PROJECT — 2024-10-04<|>EVENT<|>Reuse artifacts from dependent projects in SAP Build Process Automation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tool enabling artifact reuse across dependent projects)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE NAME CHANGE TO SAP CLOUD APPLICATION EVENT HUB — 2024-10-04<|>EVENT<|>SAP Event Broker renamed to SAP Cloud Application Event Hub)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP CLOUD APPLICATION EVENT HUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Service formerly known as SAP Event Broker for cloud applications)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP CAP APPLICATION SUPPORT AS CONSUMER — 2024-10-04<|>EVENT<|>SAP CAP apps can now consume business events via Event Hub)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REMOVAL OF SECURITY RECOMMENDATION BTP-UAA-0009 — 2024-10-03<|>EVENT<|>Deprecated security recommendation with admin failsafes added)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHORIZATION AND TRUST MANAGEMENT SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Service that removed security recommendation BTP-UAA-0009)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW SAP AUTOMATION PILOT EVENTS — 2024-10-03<|>EVENT<|>Additional Automation Pilot events supported by Alert Notification)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP AUTOMATION PILOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Service expanded with new event types for automation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW COST BREAKDOWN CHARTS IN COSTS AND USAGE PAGE — 2024-10-03<|>EVENT<|>SAP BTP Cockpit adds cost/usage breakdown charts for subaccounts)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP COCKPIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tool enhanced with new cost visualization features)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>COLLECTING DATA AND PERFORMANCE METRICS — 2024-10-07<|>SAP CLOUD ALM<|>Event transfers data to this organization's service<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA SPACE INTEGRATION AVAILABILITY — 2024-10-05<|>SAP INTEGRATION SUITE<|>Event is part of this organization's capability<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA SPACE INTEGRATION SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2024-10-05<|>SAP INTEGRATION SUITE<|>Event updates this organization's software<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>USE ARTIFACTS OF A DEPENDENT PROJECT — 2024-10-04<|>SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION<|>Event is feature of this organization's tool<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICE NAME CHANGE TO SAP CLOUD APPLICATION EVENT HUB — 2024-10-04<|>SAP CLOUD APPLICATION EVENT HUB<|>Event renamed this organization's service<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP CAP APPLICATION SUPPORT AS CONSUMER — 2024-10-04<|>SAP CLOUD APPLICATION EVENT HUB<|>Event enables integration with this organization's service<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>REMOVAL OF SECURITY RECOMMENDATION BTP-UAA-0009 — 2024-10-03<|>AUTHORIZATION AND TRUST MANAGEMENT SERVICE<|>Event modified this organization's security policies<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW SAP AUTOMATION PILOT EVENTS — 2024-10-03<|>SAP AUTOMATION PILOT<|>Event expands this organization's event library<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW COST BREAKDOWN CHARTS IN COSTS AND USAGE PAGE — 2024-10-03<|>SAP BTP COCKPIT<|>Event enhances this organization's analytics dashboard<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926083, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2096, "prompt_tokens": 3947, "total_tokens": 6043, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.04207050478491, "duration": 65.414}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
