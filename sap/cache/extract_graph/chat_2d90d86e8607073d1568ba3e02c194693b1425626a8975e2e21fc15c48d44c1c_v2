The user provided some context from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The first part mentions a \"Learning Journey\" topic that links to service roadmaps, blogs, etc. The second record is about the Google Cloud Storage Adapter supporting a new version with specific features.\n\nLooking at the entity types allowed: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nStarting with the first text: \"links to service roadmap,technology blogs, customer stories etc, can be found in the newly renamed topic Learning Journey.\" The key here is \"Learning Journey\" being a renamed topic. But according to the rules, I should only emit entities if they fit the types. \"Learning Journey\" seems like a feature or topic, not an organization, person, geo, or event. Since TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, I shouldn't emit products/services as entities. Instead, this might be an EVENT. However, the description doesn't mention a specific event like a release or change. The action is \"Info only\" and lifecycle is \"General Availability\", but the text doesn't clearly state a new capability or change that qualifies as an EVENT. Maybe not enough info here to create an event.\n\nNext, the second record: \"Google Cloud Storage Adapter Supports New Version\". The description mentions version 1.1.0 with new features. This seems like a new release, which is an EVENT. The title is \"Google Cloud Storage Adapter Supports New Version\", and the valid as of date is 2025-04-28. So the event name would be \"GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE ADAPTER NEW VERSION — 2025-04-28\". The description should mention the new version and features. \n\nFor entities, \"Google Cloud Storage Adapter\" is a product, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity type, I can't emit it. However, the adapter is part of the Google Cloud Storage service. Wait, the rules say if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, don't emit products/services, but represent changes as EVENT. So the event here is the new version support, which is an EVENT. \n\nBut the user's examples sometimes include organizations. In the second record, \"Google Cloud Storage\" is part of Google Cloud, which is an organization. So maybe \"GOOGLE CLOUD\" as an organization. The description would be \"Cloud storage service provider offering the Cloud Storage Adapter\". \n\nThen, the event \"GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE ADAPTER NEW VERSION — 2025-04-28\" would have a relationship with \"GOOGLE CLOUD\" as the organization providing the service. The relationship description would be \"Event involves organization's cloud storage service\" with strength 9.\n\nChecking the rules again: for the first text, there's no clear event, so maybe no entity. The second text creates an event and an organization. \n\nSo the output would be the organization entity and the event entity, then the relationship between them.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud storage service provider offering the Cloud Storage Adapter)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE ADAPTER NEW VERSION — 2025-04-28<|>EVENT<|>New version 1.1.0 supports Workload Identity Federation authentication and On-Premise Connectivity)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE ADAPTER NEW VERSION — 2025-04-28<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>Event involves organization's cloud storage service<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923133, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 788, "prompt_tokens": 2845, "total_tokens": 3633, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.20927856120989, "duration": 24.465}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
