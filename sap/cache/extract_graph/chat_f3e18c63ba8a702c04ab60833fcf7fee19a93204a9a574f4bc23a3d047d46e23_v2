The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given guidelines. First, I need to go through each record and identify events, organizations, GEOs, and people.\n\nStarting with Record 3421: It's about new reporting apps in SAP Advanced Financial Closing. The key points are the new apps and their features. Since it's a new feature, this should be an EVENT. The title mentions \"New Reporting Apps\" and the valid as of date is 2024-02-18. So the event name would be \"NEW REPORTING APPS — 2024-02-18\". The description should mention the four new apps and their purposes. No organizations or GEOs here, just the event.\n\nNext, Record 3422: Duplicate Target Nodes in Integration Advisor. This is a change in functionality. The event name would be \"DUPLICATE TARGET NODES — 2024-02-18\". The description explains the ability to duplicate nodes. No entities here except the event.\n\nRecord 3423: Global Code Value Mapping. Another change, so event name \"GLOBAL CODE VALUE MAPPING — 2024-02-18\". Description about mapping multiple sources to one target. No entities.\n\nRecord 3424: Software Version Update for Integration Advisor. The version is 1.83.*. This is a change, so event name \"INTEGRATION ADVISOR VERSION UPDATE — 2024-02-18\". Description mentions the version increment. The component is Integration Advisor, but since the entity types don't include technology, we don't emit it as an organization. Wait, the environment is Cloud Foundry and Neo, but those are environments, not organizations. So no org here, just the event.\n\nRecord 3425: Software Version Update for Integration Assessment. Similar to above. Event name \"INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT VERSION UPDATE — 2024-02-18\". No entities beyond the event.\n\nRecord 3426: New Rules Added in Migration Assessment. Event name \"NEW RULES ADDED TO MIGRATION ASSESSMENT — 2024-02-18\". Description lists the rules. No entities.\n\nRecord 3427: No Extraction Limit for Integration Scenarios. Event name \"NO EXTRACTION LIMIT FOR INTEGRATION SCENARIOS — 2024-02-18\". Description explains the removal of the limit. No entities.\n\nRecord 3428: Software Version Update for Migration Assessment. Event name \"MIGRATION ASSESSMENT VERSION UPDATE — 2024-02-18\". No entities.\n\nRecord 3429: Authentication via X.509 in SAP AI Core. This is a new feature. Event name \"X.509 CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION — 2024-02-18\". Description mentions support for X.509. The component is SAP AI Core, but again, since it's a technology, we don't emit it as an organization. So just the event.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations or GEOs. But in these records, there's no mention of specific organizations, GEOs, or people. All the events are about features or updates within SAP products. Since the entity types are organization, person, geo, event, and none of the records mention external organizations or locations, there are no relationships to extract. \n\nSo the output will be all the events listed, each with their descriptions, and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW REPORTING APPS — 2024-02-18<|>EVENT<|>Four new apps released for reporting: task view and organizational unit view apps with updated role templates and data scope restrictions>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DUPLICATE TARGET NODES — 2024-02-18<|>EVENT<|>Ability to duplicate target nodes in Mapping Guideline mapping editor>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL CODE VALUE MAPPING — 2024-02-18<|>EVENT<|>Support for N:1 code value mapping with multiple source lists and one target list>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATION ADVISOR VERSION UPDATE — 2024-02-18<|>EVENT<|>SAP Integration Advisor updated to version 1.83.*>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT VERSION UPDATE — 2024-02-18<|>EVENT<|>Integration Assessment updated to version 1.24.*>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW RULES ADDED TO MIGRATION ASSESSMENT — 2024-02-18<|>EVENT<|>Added OMUsageDoNotResolveXOPIncludes and SenderRESTURLPattern rules>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NO EXTRACTION LIMIT FOR INTEGRATION SCENARIOS — 2024-02-18<|>EVENT<|>Removal of integration scenario extraction limits in Migration Assessment>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MIGRATION ASSESSMENT VERSION UPDATE — 2024-02-18<|>EVENT<|>Migration Assessment updated to version 1.24.*>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>X.509 CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION — 2024-02-18<|>EVENT<|>Support for X.509 certificate authentication in SAP AI Core>)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923146, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1241, "prompt_tokens": 3953, "total_tokens": 5194, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.47585900086358, "duration": 38.213}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.

These four apps consist of the following two sets of apps:  Two apps offering a task view:  Financial Close Overview - Task View  Closing Task Completion - Task View    Two apps offering an organizational unit view:  Financial Close Overview - Organizational Unit View  Closing Task Completion - Organizational Unit View      Task view apps offer reporting based on the task overall status, while organizational unit view apps offer reporting based on the task execution status of each organizational unit. Additionally, organizational unit apps allow you to perform reporting based on company code groups, independently of country/region assignments.  Note  For these new apps, new static role templates are available that need to be assigned to users, so they can access the new apps.  Caution  The new reporting apps display data from task lists generated after the release of these apps only. Data from previous closing cycles can be viewed in the predecessor apps Financial Close Overview (Deprecated) and Closing Task Completion (Deprecated).
