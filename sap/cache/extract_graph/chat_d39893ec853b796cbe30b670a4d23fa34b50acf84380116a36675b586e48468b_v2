The user provided some data from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The text has two records. Let's look at each one.\n\nStarting with Record 3160. The component is SAP AI Launchpad, environment is Cloud Foundry. The title is \"Workspaces\" and the description mentions that connection creation through x.509 certificates is supported. The action is Info only, lifecycle is General Availability, type is New, and the valid date is 2024-04-08.\n\nAccording to the steps, I need to create EVENT entities for releases, new features, etc. Since this is a new feature (Type: New), I should create an EVENT. The name should be the title plus the valid date. So \"WORKSPACES — 2024-04-08\". The description should mention the x.509 certificate support.\n\nNext, check if there are any organizations, geo, or person entities. The environment is Cloud Foundry, but the rules say that if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services shouldn't be emitted. However, in the entity_types provided, organization is allowed. But Cloud Foundry is a platform, so maybe it's considered an organization? Wait, the user's examples include Microsoft Azure as an organization. But in the given data, the environment is Cloud Foundry, which is a service provided by SAP. However, the rules state that if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, products/services shouldn't be emitted. Wait, the entity_types here are organization, person, geo, event. The TECHNOLOGY is part of the context, but the user's instruction says that when TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products/services. But in this case, the entity_types include organization, so maybe Cloud Foundry is considered an organization? But the example D had Microsoft Azure as an organization. However, in the current data, the environment is Cloud Foundry, but the component is SAP AI Launchpad. The description mentions SAP AI Core, which is a product. But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products shouldn't be emitted. Wait, the user's entity_types include organization, so maybe Cloud Foundry is an organization? But I'm not sure. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So if the text mentions a service or product, but the entity_type is organization, then it's allowed. However, in the current data, the environment is Cloud Foundry, which is a platform. But the user's instruction says that if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products/services. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" But in this case, the entity_types include organization, so maybe Cloud Foundry is considered an organization. However, the user's examples don't have Cloud Foundry as an entity. Alternatively, maybe the environment is part of the event description but not an entity. \n\nWait, the description mentions \"Create a Service Key in SAP AI Core and Add Connection to SAP AI Core.\" SAP AI Core is a product. But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products shouldn't be emitted. However, the entity_types here include organization, so maybe SAP AI Core is not an entity. The user's instruction says that products/services/environments should not be emitted as entities when TECHNOLOGY is not allowed. But in this case, the entity_types include organization, so maybe it's allowed. But I'm confused. Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe rule says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" Wait, the user's entity_types here are organization, person, geo, event. So TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types. Therefore, products/services/environments should not be emitted as entities. So even if the text mentions SAP AI Core or Cloud Foundry, they shouldn't be emitted as entities. Therefore, the only entity here is the EVENT related to Workspaces.\n\nSo the EVENT entity would be \"WORKSPACES — 2024-04-08\" with the description about x.509 certificates. \n\nNow, relationships. The event is about Workspaces in SAP AI Launchpad. But since we can't emit the product as an entity, there's no relationship. The example D had relationships between the event and the organization (Microsoft Azure) and the geo (Sydney, Australia). In this case, there's no organization or geo mentioned in the event description. The description mentions SAP AI Core, but that's a product, which we can't emit as an entity. So no relationships would be formed here.\n\nTherefore, the output should be the EVENT entity and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>WORKSPACES — 2024-04-08<|>EVENT<|>Connection creation in Workspaces through x.509 certificates is supported per documentation>)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926817, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1115, "prompt_tokens": 2820, "total_tokens": 3935, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.84349564472369, "duration": 35.015}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
