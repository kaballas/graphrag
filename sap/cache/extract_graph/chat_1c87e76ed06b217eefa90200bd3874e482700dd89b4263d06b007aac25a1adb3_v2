The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records based on the given guidelines. First, I need to go through each record and identify events, organizations, geos, and people.\n\nStarting with Record 3131: It's about updating the Serverless module to version 1.4.0, introducing new runtimes and deprecating old ones. Since TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed entity types, I should represent this as an EVENT. The event name would be \"SERVERLESS MODULE UPDATE TO 1.4.0 — 2024-04-16\" using the Valid as Of date. The description mentions new Node.js and Python versions and deprecations. No organizations or geos here, so just the event.\n\nRecord 3132: Manage Destinations enhancements in SAP Build. Again, an EVENT: \"MANAGE DESTINATIONS ENHANCEMENTS — 2024-04-16\". No entities beyond the event.\n\nRecord 3133: Consume API Actions using Integration Flow. Another EVENT: \"CONSUME API ACTIONS VIA INTEGRATION FLOW — 2024-04-16\".\n\nRecord 3134: Fix for connection issues with SAP Business Application Studio. EVENT: \"FIX FOR CONNECTION ISSUE WITH SAP BUSINESS APPLICATION STUDIO — 2024-04-15\".\n\nRecord 3135: Upcoming Kubernetes 1.28 upgrade. EVENT: \"KYM A UPGRADE TO KUBERNETES 1.28 — 2024-04-14\".\n\nRecord 3136: Enhanced Site24x7 monitor config in AvS. EVENT: \"ENHANCED SITE24X7 MONITOR CONFIG — 2024-04-12\".\n\nRecord 3137: Training Configuration change. EVENT: \"TRAINING CONFIGURATION UPDATE — 2024-04-12\".\n\nRecord 3138: Joule available in Frankfurt, EU data center on AWS. Here, the EVENT is \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EU DATA CENTER — 2024-04-12\". Then, AWS is an ORGANIZATION, and FRANKFURT, EU is a GEO. Relationship between the event and AWS (organization) and the geo location.\n\nRecord 3139: Joule in Sydney, Australia on AWS. Similar to 3138. EVENT: \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2024-04-11\". AWS as ORGANIZATION, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA as GEO. Relationships again.\n\nRecord 3140: New data center in China (CN20) for Cloud Integration Automation. EVENT: \"CLOUD INTEGRATION AUTOMATION SERVICE AVAILABILITY IN CHINA (CN20) — 2024-01-01\". China (CN20) is a GEO, and the service is part of the event. But the service name might be a product, which isn't an entity type here. So just the event and the geo.\n\nNow, check for any other entities. The only organizations mentioned are AWS. Geos are Frankfurt, EU; Sydney, Australia; China (CN20). Events are all the updates. No persons mentioned, so none of those. Relationships are between events and their respective organizations/geos. Need to ensure the event names are correctly formatted with dates and the descriptions are concise. Also, make sure the entity types are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. Relationships should have strength between 1-10, probably 9 or 10 for direct links.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVERLESS MODULE UPDATE TO 1.4.0 — 2024-04-16<|>EVENT<|>New Node.js (v20) and Python (v3.12) runtimes introduced; Node.js v18 and Python v3.9 deprecated<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>MANAGE DESTINATIONS ENHANCEMENTS — 2024-04-16<|>EVENT<|>Business Application project type now supports destinations; UI changes to Add/Delete buttons<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>CONSUME API ACTIONS VIA INTEGRATION FLOW — 2024-04-16<|>EVENT<|>Business processes can consume integration scenarios via Integration Flow<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>FIX FOR CONNECTION ISSUE WITH SAP BUSINESS APPLICATION STUDIO — 2024-04-15<|>EVENT<|>Resolved connection issue between SAP Business Application Studio and CI/CD service<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>KYM A UPGRADE TO KUBERNETES 1.28 — 2024-04-14<|>EVENT<|>Planned Kubernetes 1.28 upgrade in April 13–14, 2024 maintenance window<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCED SITE24X7 MONITOR CONFIG — 2024-04-12<|>EVENT<|>AvS provides more configuration options for Site24x7 monitors<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>TRAINING CONFIGURATION UPDATE — 2024-04-12<|>EVENT<|>enableMasking parameter now available for Sales Order Completion executables<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EU DATA CENTER — 2024-04-12<|>EVENT<|>Joule now available in Frankfurt, EU data center of AWS<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing data center infrastructure for Joule<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKFURT, EU<|>GEO<|>Data center location for AWS where Joule is now available<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2024-04-11<|>EVENT<|>Joule now available in Sydney, Australia data center of AWS<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Data center location for AWS where Joule is now available<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD INTEGRATION AUTOMATION SERVICE AVAILABILITY IN CHINA (CN20) — 2024-01-01<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Integration Automation service now available in China (CN20) data center<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA (CN20)<|>GEO<|>Data center location for Cloud Integration Automation service<|>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EU DATA CENTER — 2024-04-12<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EU DATA CENTER — 2024-04-12<|>FRANKFURT, EU<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2024-04-11<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2024-04-11<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD INTEGRATION AUTOMATION SERVICE AVAILABILITY IN CHINA (CN20) — 2024-01-01<|>CHINA (CN20)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926889, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1807, "prompt_tokens": 3954, "total_tokens": 5761, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 11.572650886361307, "duration": 156.144}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
