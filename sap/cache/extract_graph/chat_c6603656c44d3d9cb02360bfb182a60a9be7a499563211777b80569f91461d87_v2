The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the given text based on the provided guidelines. First, I need to parse the input text and identify the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the two records provided:\n\nRecord 1309 is about Decentralized Identity Verification in Cloud Foundry. The title mentions support for Verifiable Presentations with embedded proofs. The Valid as Of date is 2025-02-27. Since the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and the component here is a technology feature, I need to check if it's an EVENT. The description talks about a new feature, so that's an event. The name should be \"SUPPORT OF VERIFIABLE PRESENTATIONS WITH EMBEDDED PROOFS — 2025-02-27\" as the event. The description would mention creating verifiable presentations with embedded proofs.\n\nRecord 1310 is about Forms Service by Adobe availability in new regions. The regions listed are cf-us20 (US West (WA)/Azure), cf-ap20 (Australia (Sydney)/Azure), and cf-sa30 (KSA (Dammam)/Google Cloud). Here, the event is the availability in new regions. The event name would be \"FORMS SERVICE BY ADOBE AVAILABILITY IN NEW REGIONS — 2025-02-27\". The description would state the service is available in these new regions. \n\nFor the regions, I need to extract the GEO entities. US West (WA) is a region, but the actual data center locations are in Azure and Google Cloud. However, the GEO should be real-world places. So, \"US WEST (WA)\" as a GEO, \"AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)\" as another GEO, and \"KSA (DAMMAM)\" as the third. The organizations here are MICROSOFT AZURE and GOOGLE CLOUD, as they are the service providers mentioned. \n\nRelationships would link the event (Forms Service availability) to the GEOs and the organizations. For example, the event occurs in the US West (WA) GEO and involves Microsoft Azure. Similarly for the other regions. The strength of the relationships would be around 9 or 10 since they are direct associations.\n\nI need to make sure all entities are in uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formatted. Also, check that no invalid entities are included. The Cloud Foundry environment is part of the technology, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't an allowed entity type, it's represented as an EVENT. \n\nSo, compiling all this, the entities would be the two events, the three GEOs, and the two organizations. Relationships connect each event to the respective GEO and organization. Let me structure that properly now.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORT OF VERIFIABLE PRESENTATIONS WITH EMBEDDED PROOFS — 2025-02-27<|>EVENT<|>Create verifiable presentations with credentials containing embedded proofs in decentralized identity verification<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>FORMS SERVICE BY ADOBE AVAILABILITY IN NEW REGIONS — 2025-02-27<|>EVENT<|>SAP Forms service now available in cf-us20, cf-ap20, and cf-sa30 cloud regions<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>US WEST (WA)<|>GEO<|>Cloud region for SAP Forms service availability via Azure<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)<|>GEO<|>Cloud region for SAP Forms service availability via Azure<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>KSA (DAMMAM)<|>GEO<|>Cloud region for SAP Forms service availability via Google Cloud<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud infrastructure provider for US West (WA) and Australia (Sydney) regions<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud infrastructure provider for KSA (Dammam) region<|>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FORMS SERVICE BY ADOBE AVAILABILITY IN NEW REGIONS — 2025-02-27<|>US WEST (WA)<|>Event occurs in this geographic region<|>9)  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FORMS SERVICE BY ADOBE AVAILABILITY IN NEW REGIONS — 2025-02-27<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>Event utilizes infrastructure provided by this organization<|>10)  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FORMS SERVICE BY ADOBE AVAILABILITY IN NEW REGIONS — 2025-02-27<|>AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)<|>Event occurs in this geographic region<|>9)  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FORMS SERVICE BY ADOBE AVAILABILITY IN NEW REGIONS — 2025-02-27<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>Event utilizes infrastructure provided by this organization<|>10)  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FORMS SERVICE BY ADOBE AVAILABILITY IN NEW REGIONS — 2025-02-27<|>KSA (DAMMAM)<|>Event occurs in this geographic region<|>9)  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FORMS SERVICE BY ADOBE AVAILABILITY IN NEW REGIONS — 2025-02-27<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>Event utilizes infrastructure provided by this organization<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925902, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1235, "prompt_tokens": 2930, "total_tokens": 4165, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.12381323969307, "duration": 38.445}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
