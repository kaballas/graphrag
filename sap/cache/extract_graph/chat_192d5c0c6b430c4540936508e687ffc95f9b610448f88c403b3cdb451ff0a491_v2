The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records using the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records mention components like Pricing Service, Variant Configuration, Kyma Runtime, etc., but these are products/services, which under the rules should be represented as EVENT entities if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed. However, looking at the examples, when TECHNOLOGY is part of the context, they still create EVENT entities for the changes.\n\nStarting with Record 11: The title is \"Production – Stateless Pricing – Validity-Based Selection of Condition Records in Price Agreements\". The valid as of date is 2025-11-12. This seems like a new feature, so an EVENT entity. The description mentions support for processing multiple condition records with validity periods. The entity name would be \"STATELESS PRICING VALIDITY-BASED SELECTION — 2025-11-12\" with the description about handling time-dependent conditions.\n\nRecord 12: \"Production– US Tax Calculation via External Engine\" with the same valid date. This is another new feature, so EVENT. The description says US tax calculation via external engine is supported. Entity name: \"US TAX CALCULATION VIA EXTERNAL ENGINE — 2025-11-12\" and description about supporting US taxes with external engine.\n\nRecord 13: \"Production - Configurations API – Dependency Profiling Trace\" with valid date 2025-11-12. This is a new feature, so EVENT. The description talks about measuring dependency runtimes. Entity name: \"CONFIGURATIONS API DEPENDENCY PROFILING TRACE — 2025-11-12\" with the description about runtime measurement and UI display.\n\nRecord 14: \"Production - Configurations API – On-Request Tracing\" same date. New setting ON_REQUEST introduced. EVENT entity: \"CONFIGURATIONS API ON-REQUEST TRACING — 2025-11-12\" with description about collecting traces for specific requests.\n\nRecord 15: \"Production - Configurations API – Read Dependency Information\" same date. New endpoint added. EVENT: \"CONFIGURATIONS API READ DEPENDENCY INFORMATION — 2025-11-12\" with the endpoint details.\n\nRecord 16: \"Telemetry module: Deletion of LogParser API\" with valid date 2025-10-30. This is a deletion, so EVENT. Entity name: \"LOGPARSER API DELETION — 2025-10-30\" and description about deprecation and switch to JSON-based logging.\n\nRecord 17: \"Update to: Improvement of the overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters...\" valid as of 2025-10-30. This is an improvement, so EVENT. Entity name: \"CLOUD LOGGING OPENSEARCH STABILITY IMPROVEMENT — 2025-10-30\" with the description about index sizing and new format.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. However, in these records, there's no mention of specific organizations, people, or geos beyond the environments like Cloud Foundry, Kyma, etc. But according to the rules, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. Since Cloud Foundry and Kyma are environments, they might be considered as part of the event descriptions but not as separate entities. However, in the examples, when a product is mentioned, it's part of the event name. \n\nLooking at the examples, like in Example A, DigiCert is an organization. Here, the environments like Cloud Foundry, Kyma are part of the component environments but not explicitly mentioned as organizations. So, perhaps no relationships are needed here because there's no explicit mention of organizations, people, or geos beyond the event itself. \n\nTherefore, the output will be the list of EVENT entities without relationships since there are no other entities to link to.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>STATELESS PRICING VALIDITY-BASED SELECTION — 2025-11-12<|>EVENT<|>Price agreements support multiple condition records with same type but different validity periods; automatic selection based on pricing date)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>US TAX CALCULATION VIA EXTERNAL ENGINE — 2025-11-12<|>EVENT<|>US tax calculation now supported via external tax engine for pricing service)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CONFIGURATIONS API DEPENDENCY PROFILING TRACE — 2025-11-12<|>EVENT<|>Measure dependency runtimes for performance analysis; trace via x-cps-trace header; displayed in admin UI)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CONFIGURATIONS API ON-REQUEST TRACING — 2025-11-12<|>EVENT<|>New ON_REQUEST trace setting collects traces for subset of requests using x-cps-trace header)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CONFIGURATIONS API READ DEPENDENCY INFORMATION — 2025-11-12<|>EVENT<|>New endpoint to retrieve dependency data including name, description, type, and source code)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LOGPARSER API DELETION — 2025-10-30<|>EVENT<|>LogParser API deprecated in Telemetry module 1.1.0; scheduled deletion by October 2025; switch to JSON-based logging)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD LOGGING OPENSEARCH STABILITY IMPROVEMENT — 2025-10-30<|>EVENT<|>Improved OpenSearch cluster stability via index rollover; OpenTelemetry indexes now use numeric suffixes)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926565, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1302, "prompt_tokens": 3918, "total_tokens": 5220, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.55895371227088, "duration": 39.989}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Dependency execution runtimes and counts are recorded and displayed in the administration UI for the configuration service in the section Configuration  Trace   Dependency Profiling Trace.   Dependency profiling is unavailable for products processed through AVC Forwarding. Only dependencies executed within the native engine of the Variant Configuration service will be profiled.

To achieve this we already switched from daily indexes to the index rollover approach (see previous announcement from 17. April 2025 for non OpenTelemetry workload indexes.This announcement deals with OpenTelemetry logs and metrics indexes (logs-otel-v1-, metrics-otel-v1-) targeting the release date - 29./30. October 2025.   With this change OpenTelemetry logs and metrics index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you are using the OpenTelemetry logs/metrics feature and rely on\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_192d5c0c6b430c4540936508e687ffc95f9b610448f88c403b3cdb451ff0a491_v2"}
