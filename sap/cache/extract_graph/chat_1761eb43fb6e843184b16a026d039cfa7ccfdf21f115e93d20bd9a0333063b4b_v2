The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the user mentioned that if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. But looking at the records, the components like Pricing Service, SAP Task Center, Workflow Capability are part of the SAP ecosystem, but the instructions say not to emit products/services/environments as entities unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. However, the examples show that when TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, changes are represented as events. \n\nLooking at the first record (Record 2551): It's about updating service keys and bindings for SAP Task Center. The action is required, and it's an announcement. This seems like an event because it's a required action for users. The event name would be something like \"SERVICE KEYS AND BINDINGS UPDATE — 2024-07-24\". The description would mention the need to update keys by August 31, 2024. \n\nNext, Record 2552: It's about a codebase refactoring for My Inbox in Neo environment. The action is required, and users need to publish the site and clear the cache. This is an event too. The event name could be \"MY INBOX CODEBASE REFACTORING — 2024-07-24\". The description would note the error due to incompatibility and the steps needed.\n\nRecords 2553 to 2558 are about Pricing Service updates. They mention new features and changes, but the action is \"Info only\". According to the rules, if the action is \"Info only\", maybe they don't need to be events? Wait, the steps say to construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability. These records are about new capabilities (like new APIs, enhanced fields), so they should be events. \n\nFor example, Record 2553: \"Condition Exclusion on Condition Record Level\" is a new feature. The event name would be \"CONDITION EXCLUSION ON CONDITION RECORD LEVEL — 2024-07-24\". The description would mention the exclusion indicator being considered in condition determination. \n\nSimilarly, Record 2554: \"Consider Cost Conditions as External Conditions\" is a change, so an event. The name would be \"COST CONDITIONS AS EXTERNAL CONDITIONS — 2024-07-24\". \n\nRecords 2555 and 2556 mention returning scales order, which are new features. So events with those names. \n\nRecord 2557: New APIs for testing local extensions. Event name would be \"NEW APIs TO TEST LOCAL EXTENSIONS — 2024-07-24\". \n\nNow, checking for organizations. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry and Neo, which are SAP environments. But according to the rules, ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned. Since Cloud Foundry and Neo are SAP's environments, but the user examples didn't include them as organizations. However, in Example D, Microsoft Azure was an organization. So maybe SAP BTP or SAP Cloud Foundry would be organizations. But the records here don't explicitly mention organizations beyond the component names. \n\nWait, the user's examples included \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as an organization. In the current data, the environments are Cloud Foundry and Neo, which are SAP's platforms. But the instructions say not to emit products/services/environments as entities unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. Since Cloud Foundry and Neo are not explicitly named as organizations here, maybe they shouldn't be emitted. However, in the examples, when the technology was part of the event, they were not emitted as entities. \n\nSo, the only entities here would be the events. No organizations, persons, or geos are mentioned in the text. Therefore, all the extracted entities would be events. \n\nNow, relationships: The examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. But in this case, there are no organizations or geos mentioned, so no relationships would be emitted. \n\nSo, the output would be a list of events for each record that qualifies as an event. Each event's name is constructed with the title and the valid as of date. The descriptions are concise, summarizing the key points. \n\nI need to make sure that each event's name is in the format \"<SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE>\" using \"Valid as Of\" date. The descriptions are under 25 words. Also, check that entity names are uppercase. \n\nLet me go through each record again to confirm:\n\nRecord 2551: Event name \"SERVICE KEYS AND BINDINGS UPDATE — 2024-07-24\". Description: Required action to update service keys and bindings by August 31, 2024.\n\nRecord 2552: Event name \"MY INBOX CODEBASE REFACTORING — 2024-07-24\". Description: Error due to incompatibility; steps to publish site and clear cache.\n\nRecords 2553-2557: Each has a new feature or change, so events with their respective titles and dates. \n\nNo organizations, persons, or geos, so no relationships. \n\nThus, the final output is a list of these events.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE KEYS AND BINDINGS UPDATE — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Required action to update SAP Task Center service keys and bindings by August 31, 2024)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MY INBOX CODEBASE REFACTORING — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Error due to My Inbox version incompatibility; steps to publish site and clear cache required)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CONDITION EXCLUSION ON CONDITION RECORD LEVEL — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Exclusion indicator now considered in condition determination for pricing procedures)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>COST CONDITIONS AS EXTERNAL CONDITIONS — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Cost condition types without access sequences now treated as external conditions)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RETURN SCALES ORDER FOR CONDITION TYPES — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>New scaleOrder field added to condition type information for API callers)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RETURN SCALES ORDER FOR ITEM CONDITIONS — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>New scaleOrder field added to item condition scale details for API callers)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW APIs TO TEST LOCAL EXTENSIONS — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Endpoints added to test local extension routines directly in non-productive tenants)>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925286, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1543, "prompt_tokens": 3928, "total_tokens": 5471, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 33.26793298980186, "duration": 46.381}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

To be able to use it, the following standard requirement formulas were changed:    Requirement formula 5 is now supported. It ensures that a condition type is only considered if the exclusion indicator was not set by a previously found condition record.      Requirement formula 6 is now supported. It ensures that a condition type is only considered if the exclusion indicator was not set to X by a previously found condition record.      Requirement formula 2 was enhanced to not only check if the pricing indicator (KOMP-PRSFD) equals X or B, but to also check that the exclusion indicator was not set by a previously found condition record.
