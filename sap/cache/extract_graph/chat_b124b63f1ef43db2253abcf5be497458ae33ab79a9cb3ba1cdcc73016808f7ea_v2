The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given guidelines. \n\nFirst, I need to parse each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records mention \"SAP Document AI\" and \"Cloud Foundry,\" but according to the steps, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, products/services should be represented as events. However, the user's entity types include organization, so I need to check if any organizations are mentioned.\n\nLooking at the first record: \"Combine Different Setup Types When Adding Data Fields to Schemas.\" This is a change in functionality, so it's an event. The title can be formatted as \"COMBINE DIFFERENT SETUP TYPES IN SCHEMAS — 2024-02-20\" with a description about combining header fields.\n\nSecond record: \"Invoices - Conversion of Country Specific Unit of Measure Values to ISO Format.\" Another change, so event entity. Title: \"INVOICES UNIT CONVERSION TO ISO FORMAT — 2024-02-20\" with the description about improved conversion.\n\nThird record: \"Support for businessCard Documents in AWS region Australia (Sydney).\" Here, AWS is mentioned as an organization. The geo is Australia (Sydney). The event is the support for business cards in that region. So, the event entity would be \"BUSINESSCARD DOCUMENT SUPPORT IN AWS SYDNEY — 2024-02-20.\" Then, relationships between the event and AWS (organization) and Sydney (geo).\n\nI need to make sure all entities are in uppercase and fit the types. Check for any other organizations or geos. AWS is an organization, Sydney, Australia is a geo. The other records don't mention other entities. \n\nFor relationships, the third event involves AWS and Sydney. So relationships would link the event to AWS (infrastructure) and Sydney (location). The strength is 9 and 10 respectively, as per examples.\n\nNo persons mentioned, so none of those. Descriptions are under 25 words. All set.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>COMBINE DIFFERENT SETUP TYPES IN SCHEMAS — 2024-02-20<|>EVENT<|>Combine header fields with auto/manual setup types in schemas for standard/custom document types with service plan restrictions>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INVOICES UNIT CONVERSION TO ISO FORMAT — 2024-02-20<|>EVENT<|>Improved conversion of country-specific unit of measure values to ISO format for invoice documents>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESSCARD DOCUMENT SUPPORT IN AWS SYDNEY — 2024-02-20<|>EVENT<|>BusinessCard documents now supported in AWS Australia (Sydney) region>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for SAP Document AI>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)<|>GEO<|>AWS region where BusinessCard document support is now available>)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BUSINESSCARD DOCUMENT SUPPORT IN AWS SYDNEY — 2024-02-20<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BUSINESSCARD DOCUMENT SUPPORT IN AWS SYDNEY — 2024-02-20<|>AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925472, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 788, "prompt_tokens": 3119, "total_tokens": 3907, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.056635005714735, "duration": 25.373}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
