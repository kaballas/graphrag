The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and see what qualifies as an event. The instructions say that whenever there's a release, upgrade, new feature, etc., we should create an EVENT entity. The name should be a short title followed by the date from \"Valid as Of\" or \"Latest Revision\". \n\nLooking at Record 101: It's about using the Migration API to offboard data without data loss. That's a new feature, so an EVENT. The title would be \"OFFBOARD DATA — 2025-09-16\" using the Valid as Of date. The description mentions the Migration API and data offboarding.\n\nRecord 102: New features in SAP Datasphere 2025.19. The title would be \"FEATURES FOR VERSION 2025.19 — 2025-09-16\". The description refers to new and changed features.\n\nRecord 103: SAP Document Management Service as a repository for AI Launchpad. This is an announcement, so EVENT. Title: \"GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-09-15\". Description mentions the repository support.\n\nRecords 104-110: All are new features in Edge Integration Cell. Each has a title and a Valid as Of date. For example, Record 104: \"ACCESS TO RUNTIME PARAMETERS — 2025-09-14\" with description about moving Runtime Parameters to Component Monitor.\n\nNow, checking for entities. The EVENT entities are straightforward. Are there any organizations, geos, or persons mentioned? The components like SAP Document Management Service, SAP Datasphere, SAP AI Launchpad, Edge Integration Cell are products, not organizations. The environments are Cloud Foundry, Neo, but those are platforms, not organizations. The user instructions say not to emit products/services as entities unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed, but in this case, the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. Since TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, products aren't entities. So only the EVENTs are emitted.\n\nNo relationships are mentioned in the text, so no relationships to extract. Each record is a separate event. Need to make sure the entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and formatted correctly. Also, check for any possible organizations or geos, but none are present here. So the output will be a list of EVENT entities with their descriptions.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>OFFBOARD DATA — 2025-09-16<|>EVENT<|>Use Migration API to offboard SAP Document Management Service data without loss)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURES FOR VERSION 2025.19 — 2025-09-16<|>EVENT<|>New and changed features available for SAP Datasphere 2025.19 release)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-09-15<|>EVENT<|>SAP Document Management Service supported as repository for AI orchestration grounding)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ACCESS TO RUNTIME PARAMETERS — 2025-09-14<|>EVENT<|>Runtime Parameters now accessible only via Component Monitor, not Quick Links)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CONFIGURE ISTIO PROXY RESOURCES — 2025-09-14<|>EVENT<|>Manually increase resource limits for Istio Proxies in worker components)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EDGE LOCAL AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION SUPPORT — 2025-09-14<|>EVENT<|>External certificate pinning enforces renewed certificate usage for authentication)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENABLING ADK PERSISTENCY — 2025-09-14<|>EVENT<|>Adapter API enables data persistence for ADK after node restarts or crashes)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW ACTION IN JOB MANAGEMENT — 2025-09-14<|>EVENT<|>Consolidate MPL Aggregation Data action added to Job Management)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REUSABLE API ARTIFACT — 2025-09-14<|>EVENT<|>Create modular API artifacts for policies, mediation, and validation logic)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RFC ADAPTER RECEIVER SUPPORTED IN DIAGNOSTICS — 2025-09-14<|>EVENT<|>Adapter diagnostics now supports RFC adapter with receiver direction)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926113, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1045, "prompt_tokens": 3859, "total_tokens": 4904, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 7.86181265563756, "duration": 132.921}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
