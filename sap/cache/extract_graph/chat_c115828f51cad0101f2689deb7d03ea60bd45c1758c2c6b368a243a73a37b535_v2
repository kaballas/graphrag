The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to parse each record and identify events, organizations, geos, and people.\n\nStarting with the first record about the CF CLI Plugin. The main point is that the plugin needs an update. The action is required, and the valid date is 2024-07-25. Since this is an announcement, I should create an EVENT entity. The name would be \"CF CLI PLUGIN UPDATE REQUIRED — 2024-07-25\" with a description mentioning the need to update the plugin and the GitHub link. No organizations or geos here, so no relationships.\n\nNext, the Application Autoscaler record. The main event is the end of support for Basic HTTP Auth. The event name would be \"END OF SUPPORT FOR BASIC HTTP AUTH IN APPLICATION AUTOSCALER — 2025-04-30\" since that's the date when only x509 will be valid. The description should note the removal of basic auth and the transition to x509. There's a mention of mTLS and Defining a Custom Metric, but those might not be entities. The action is recommended, but the event is the main thing. No organizations or geos here either, so no relationships.\n\nThird record: Cloud Identity Services in China. The IPs are changing. The event is \"CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES REGIONAL AVAILABILITY UPDATE — 2024-07-25\". The description mentions the new IPs and the old ones being retired. The geos here are CHINA, and the organization is CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES. So, relationships would link the event to China (geo) and the organization. The IPs are part of the description but not entities as they're not real places or organizations.\n\nFourth record: Java Server Tomcat update. The event is \"TOMCAT VERSION UPDATE FOR JAVA WEB TOMCAT 9 — 2024-07-25\". The description includes the version update and security fixes. No organizations or geos here, so no relationships.\n\nNow, checking entity types. For the Cloud Identity Services record, the organization is CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES. The geo is CHINA. The event is the regional availability update. Relationships would be between the event and the organization (involves) and the event and the geo (occurs in). The strength for the organization relationship might be 8, and for the geo, 9.\n\nOther records don't have organizations or geos, so only events. Need to make sure all entity names are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. Relationships are only if there's a clear link, like event involving an organization or occurring in a location.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CF CLI PLUGIN UPDATE REQUIRED — 2024-07-25<|>EVENT<|>Update required for CF CLI Plugin; see GitHub for details)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>END OF SUPPORT FOR BASIC HTTP AUTH IN APPLICATION AUTOSCALER — 2025-04-30<|>EVENT<|>Basic HTTP Auth removed for Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API; transition to x509 credential-type required)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES REGIONAL AVAILABILITY UPDATE — 2024-07-25<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services now uses IPs 121.91.104.198/204 in China; 157.133.186.67/78 retired)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TOMCAT VERSION UPDATE FOR JAVA WEB TOMCAT 9 — 2024-07-25<|>EVENT<|>Java Web Tomcat 9 updated to 9.0.90 with security fixes; update applications to latest runtime)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud identity management service operating in China data centers)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>Region where Cloud Identity Services updated IP addresses for data center operations)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES REGIONAL AVAILABILITY UPDATE — 2024-07-25<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES REGIONAL AVAILABILITY UPDATE — 2024-07-25<|>CHINA<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923139, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1015, "prompt_tokens": 3710, "total_tokens": 4725, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.74933049398251, "duration": 30.993}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

The target audience of the change is developers:   Until now, service bindings of the Application Autoscaler always provided url, username, and password in the credentials section. These credentials could be used to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using the “Basic” HTTP Authentication security scheme.  What changes  We are going to remove the support for “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API.   To enable you to prepare and test this transition, we are introducing a new parameter credential-type, which can be used to proactively prepare for the removal.  Note  Alternatively, you have the option to change the behavior up to three months later.   If no credential types are defined in the service binding parameters, the Application Autoscaler service applies a default. This default is for now binding-secret.       When the credential-type binding-secret is chosen, url, username, and password will be provided in the credentials section.       When the credential-type x509 is chosen, url, username and password are not provided in the credentials section.       Regardless of which credential-type is active, it is always possible access to the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using mTLS, see Defining a Custom Metric.  On 2025-01-22, we plan to change the credential-type default to x509, but you will still be able to explicitly specify the credential-type binding-secret.   Starting, 2025-04-30 only the credential-type x509 will be valid, either set explicitly, or by default, if not set explicitly.  Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       Or the credential-type parameter is set to binding-secret during the creation of the binding.      If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type\", \"x509\"]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.   For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.\nAction: Recommended\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-07-25\nValid as Of: 2024-07-25\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 2539 ---\nComponent: Cloud Identity Services\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo\nTitle: Regional Availability\nDescription: Cloud Identity Services now operates with two IPs in the data center in China: 121.91.104.198 and 121.91.104.204   The following IPs are no longer in use: 157.133.186.67 and 157.133.186.78.
