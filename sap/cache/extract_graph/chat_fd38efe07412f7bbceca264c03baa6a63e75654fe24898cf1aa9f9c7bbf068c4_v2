The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify the events. The main focus here is on Joule's new features and availability in different data centers. \n\nLooking at Record 76, it mentions Joule being available in Sydney, Australia data center of Microsoft Azure. That's an event. The entity here would be the availability event, and the related organizations and geo locations would be Microsoft Azure and Sydney, Australia. \n\nSimilarly, Record 77 talks about Singapore data center of AWS. So another event for Joule's availability in Singapore, with AWS as the organization and Singapore as the geo.\n\nFor Records 71, 72, 74, 75, 78, 79, they describe new use cases, capabilities, and role-based access. Since these are enhancements or new features, they should be represented as events. The entity names would be the specific features or changes, with the valid dates. \n\nI need to make sure that each event is named properly, using the title and valid as of date. Also, check if any products or services are mentioned as organizations. For example, Microsoft Azure and AWS are valid organizations. \n\nNo person names are mentioned, so those can be ignored. Geos like Sydney, Australia and Singapore are valid. \n\nNow, relationships: the events (availability in data centers) are linked to the organizations (Microsoft Azure, AWS) and geos (Sydney, Australia, Singapore). Also, the new features are events that involve Joule, but since Joule is a product, and the entity types don't include technology, I need to represent these as events without emitting Joule as an entity. Wait, the user's instruction says if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services/environments should be represented as events. But in the entity types, the user included organization, person, geo, event. So Joule is a product, but since it's not in the allowed entity types, it's not emitted as an entity. However, the events are about Joule's features, so the event names include \"Joule\" in the title. \n\nWait, the user's validation says: if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services/environments should be represented as EVENT entities. But in the entity types, the user has allowed EVENT. So the events are about Joule's features, but Joule itself isn't an entity. So the event names will include \"Joule\" in the title, but Joule isn't an entity. \n\nSo for each record, the event is the main entity. For example, \"NEW USE CASES SUPPORTED IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-03-26\" is an event. \n\nNow, checking each record:\n\nRecord 71: New Use Cases in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. Event name would be \"NEW USE CASES SUPPORTED IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-03-26\". Description mentions the objects like Inspection Method, etc. \n\nRecord 72: New Use Cases in SAP SuccessFactors. Event name \"NEW USE CASES SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2025-03-26\".\n\nRecord 73: Navigational and Transactional Capabilities Support Extended. Event name \"NAVIGATIONAL AND TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES SUPPORT EXTENDED TO SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION FPS02 AND FPS01 — 2025-03-25\".\n\nRecord 74: New Use Cases in Sales for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Event name \"NEW USE CASES SUPPORTED IN SALES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-03-25\".\n\nRecord 75: Document Grounding Capability supports JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF. Event name \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY SUPPORT FOR JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF — 2025-02-10\".\n\nRecord 76: Availability in Sydney, Australia data center of Microsoft Azure. Event name \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2025-02-07\". Relationships to Microsoft Azure (organization) and Sydney, Australia (geo).\n\nRecord 77: Availability in Singapore data center of AWS. Event name \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SINGAPORE DATA CENTER — 2025-01-30\". Relationships to AWS (organization) and Singapore (geo).\n\nRecord 78: Roles based access for Joule Standalone Web Client. Event name \"ROLES BASED ACCESS FOR JOULE STANDALONE WEB CLIENT — 2025-01-29\".\n\nRecord 79: All SAP SuccessFactors Use Cases Upgraded to New Conversational Experience. Event name \"ALL SAP SUCCESSFACTORS USE CASES UPGRADED TO NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE IN JOULE — 2025-01-17\".\n\nNow, check for any other entities. The organizations are Microsoft Azure and AWS. Geos are Sydney, Australia and Singapore. The rest are events. \n\nRelationships: For the availability events (76 and 77), link the event to the organization and geo. For example, the Sydney event is linked to Microsoft Azure and Sydney, Australia. The Singapore event is linked to AWS and Singapore. \n\nOther events don't have relationships to other entities, so no relationships needed. \n\nNow, format each entity and relationship as per the instructions. Make sure entity names are uppercase, descriptions are concise, and relationships are correctly linked with strength.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES SUPPORTED IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports viewing business data for inspection methods, master inspection characteristics, enterprise projects, and more in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Joule adds use cases for changing \"To Be Hired\" status and working time for positions in SAP SuccessFactors)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NAVIGATIONAL AND TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES SUPPORT EXTENDED TO SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION FPS02 AND FPS01 — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Joule extends navigational/transactional support to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition FPS02 and FPS01)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES SUPPORTED IN SALES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Joule adds sales transactional use cases for order blocks, delivery dates, and pricing adjustments in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY SUPPORT FOR JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF — 2025-02-10<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports document grounding for JPEG, JPG, PNG, and TIFF file formats)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2025-02-07<|>EVENT<|>Joule is now available in Microsoft Azure's Sydney, Australia data center)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SINGAPORE DATA CENTER — 2025-01-30<|>EVENT<|>Joule is now available in AWS's Singapore data center)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ROLES BASED ACCESS FOR JOULE STANDALONE WEB CLIENT — 2025-01-29<|>EVENT<|>Joule Standalone Web Client requires end_user or capability_developer roles in SAP BTP for login)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALL SAP SUCCESSFACTORS USE CASES UPGRADED TO NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE IN JOULE — 2025-01-17<|>EVENT<|>SAP SuccessFactors use cases in Joule upgraded to new conversational experience)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2025-02-07<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2025-02-07<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SINGAPORE DATA CENTER — 2025-01-30<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SINGAPORE DATA CENTER — 2025-01-30<|>SINGAPORE<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925675, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2074, "prompt_tokens": 3932, "total_tokens": 6006, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.03861119425322, "duration": 66.82}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
