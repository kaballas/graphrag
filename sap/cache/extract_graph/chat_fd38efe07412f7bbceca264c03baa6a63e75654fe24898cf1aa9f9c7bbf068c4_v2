The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP release notes based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the entity types include organization and geo, I need to look for those as well.\n\nLooking at Record 71: It's about new use cases in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. The event name would be \"NEW USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-03-26\". The description mentions viewing business data for specific objects. No organizations or geos here, so just the event.\n\nRecord 72: New use cases in SAP SuccessFactors. Event name \"NEW USE CASES IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2025-03-26\". Description includes changing position status and working time. Again, no orgs or geos, just the event.\n\nRecord 73: Navigational and transactional support extended to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Event name \"NAVIGATIONAL AND TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES EXTENDED TO SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-03-25\". The description mentions FPS03, FPS02, FPS01. No orgs or geos here.\n\nRecord 74: New use cases in Sales for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Event name \"NEW USE CASES IN SALES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-03-25\". The description lists various sales order actions. No orgs or geos.\n\nRecord 75: Document grounding supports JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF. Event name \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF — 2025-02-10\". No orgs or geos.\n\nRecord 76: Joule available in Sydney, Australia data center of Microsoft Azure. Here, the event is \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2025-02-07\". Then, Microsoft Azure is an organization, and Sydney, Australia is a geo. Relationships: event involves Microsoft Azure and occurs in Sydney.\n\nRecord 77: Joule available in Singapore data center of AWS. Event name \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SINGAPORE DATA CENTER — 2025-01-30\". AWS is an organization, Singapore is a geo. Relationships: event involves AWS and occurs in Singapore.\n\nRecord 78: Roles-based access for Joule Standalone Web Client. Event name \"ROLES-BASED ACCESS FOR JOULE STANDALONE WEB CLIENT — 2025-01-29\". No orgs or geos here.\n\nRecord 79: All SAP SuccessFactors use cases upgraded to new conversational experience. Event name \"ALL SAP SUCCESSFACTORS USE CASES UPGRADED TO NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE — 2025-01-17\". No orgs or geos.\n\nNow, check for organizations and geos. In records 76 and 77, Microsoft Azure and AWS are organizations, Sydney, Australia and Singapore are geos. \n\nFor relationships, each event (availability in data centers) connects to the organization (Microsoft Azure/AWS) and the geo (Sydney/Singapore). The strength is high, maybe 9 or 10.\n\nMake sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formatted. Also, ensure no invalid entities are included. \n\nDouble-check the dates: for Record 79, the valid as of date is cut off, but the example uses \"Valid as Of\" so I'll use that. The event name includes the date as 2025-01-17.\n\nNow, compile all entities and relationships in the required format.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports viewing business data for inspection methods, master inspection characteristics, enterprise projects, process orders, solution orders, and service contracts in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports changing \"To Be Hired\" status and working time for positions in SAP SuccessFactors)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NAVIGATIONAL AND TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES EXTENDED TO SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports navigational and transactional capabilities for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition FPS03 in FPS02 and FPS01)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN SALES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports transactional use cases for sales orders, delivery blocks, billing blocks, and schedule lines in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF — 2025-02-10<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports document grounding for JPEG, JPG, PNG, and TIFF file formats)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2025-02-07<|>EVENT<|>Joule is now available in Microsoft Azure's Sydney, Australia data center)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing data center infrastructure for Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Data center location for Microsoft Azure where Joule is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SINGAPORE DATA CENTER — 2025-01-30<|>EVENT<|>Joule is now available in AWS's Singapore data center)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing data center infrastructure for Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>GEO<|>Data center location for AWS where Joule is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ROLES-BASED ACCESS FOR JOULE STANDALONE WEB CLIENT — 2025-01-29<|>EVENT<|>Joule Standalone Web Client now requires end_user or capability_developer roles in SAP BTP for login)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALL SAP SUCCESSFACTORS USE CASES UPGRADED TO NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE — 2025-01-17<|>EVENT<|>SAP SuccessFactors use cases upgraded to new conversational experience in Joule)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2025-02-07<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA DATA CENTER — 2025-02-07<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SINGAPORE DATA CENTER — 2025-01-30<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SINGAPORE DATA CENTER — 2025-01-30<|>SINGAPORE<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921155, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1824, "prompt_tokens": 3564, "total_tokens": 5388, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 39.08208523494247, "duration": 46.671}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
