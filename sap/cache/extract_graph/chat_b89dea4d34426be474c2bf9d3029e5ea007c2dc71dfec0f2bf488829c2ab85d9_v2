The user provided a detailed text about various improvements in SAP Analytics Cloud and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps. First, I need to parse the text and identify events, organizations, geo, and persons.\n\nLooking at the text, the main updates are about Planning improvements, Calendar improvements, Modeling improvements, and Augmented Analytics improvements. Since the entity types include EVENT, I should create event entities for each of these sections. The dates mentioned are \"Valid as Of: 2024-04-03\" in the example, but in the real data provided, there's no explicit date. However, the examples show that if a date isn't present, \"Latest Revision\" is used. But the user's real data doesn't have a date, so maybe I should check if there's any date mentioned. Wait, the original text doesn't have a \"Valid as Of\" date. Hmm, the examples in the instructions had dates, but the real data here doesn't. The user's instruction says to use \"Valid as Of\" if present, else \"Latest Revision\". Since there's no date here, I'll use \"LATEST REVISION\" as the date part for the event names.\n\nNext, the event names should be short titles followed by the date. For example, \"PLANNING IMPROVEMENTS — LATEST REVISION\". Then, the description should summarize the key points. The Planning improvements include migrating allocation processes, data action designer changes, CONFIG.READ_CALCULATED_MEMBER_VALUES, and virtual variables. The Calendar improvements involve API access and integration with Microsoft tools. Modeling improvements include the redesigned modeler, new model types, Data Export API, and formulas like YTD. Augmented Analytics has Just Ask enhancements, accuracy, relevancy, and commenting/scheduling changes.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. The text mentions SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP HANA Cloud platform, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Teams. These are organizations. Microsoft is an organization, so \"MICROSOFT\" as an organization. SAP Analytics Cloud and SAP HANA Cloud are also organizations. \n\nGEO isn't mentioned here, so no geo entities. PERSON isn't mentioned either. \n\nFor relationships, events involving organizations. For example, the Calendar improvements event involves Microsoft Outlook and Teams. The Modeling improvements event involves SAP HANA Cloud. The Data Export API is part of SAP Analytics Cloud. \n\nI need to make sure each entity is correctly categorized. The event descriptions should be under 25 words. Relationships should link events to organizations or geos. Since there's no geo, only organizations. \n\nLet me structure each entity and relationship step by step, ensuring they meet the criteria.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING IMPROVEMENTS — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Manual migration of allocation processes to data actions; enhanced formula configurations; virtual variable support for version dimension<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALENDAR IMPROVEMENTS — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>External API access for calendar events; integration with Microsoft Outlook and Teams<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>MODELING IMPROVEMENTS — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Redesigned modeler with flexible modeling workflows; new model types; YTD/QTD/MTD formulas<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUGMENTED ANALYTICS IMPROVEMENTS — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Enhanced Just Ask AI with LLM learning, synonym customization, and improved query relevancy<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud analytics platform with modeling, planning, and augmented analytics capabilities<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP HANA CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud database platform supporting advanced formula configurations<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provider of Outlook and Teams integration for calendar events<|>  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CALENDAR IMPROVEMENTS — LATEST REVISION<|>MICROSOFT<|>Event integrates with Microsoft's calendar tools<|>8)  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MODELING IMPROVEMENTS — LATEST REVISION<|>SAP HANA CLOUD<|>Event supports configurations on SAP HANA Cloud platform<|>7)  \n(\"relationship\"<|>AUGMENTED ANALYTICS IMPROVEMENTS — LATEST REVISION<|>SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD<|>Event enhances AI capabilities within SAP Analytics Cloud<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925718, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 987, "prompt_tokens": 3852, "total_tokens": 4839, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 30.528920507268793, "duration": 32.33}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Note that: Previously, you can add data point comments when a restricted cross calculation is used in the filter, but the specific filters on dimensions used to define this cross calculation will not be included in the context for comments. Now, they will be included in the context. Comments are not supported for calculated cross calculations or aggregations. Comments sourced from restricted cross calculations will also be shown in the comment widget when the same context applies.    Planning mprovements:   You can now manually migrate a copy of an existing allocation process or step to a data action with the Migrate to Data Action button in the legacy allocations app. The existing allocation process or step won't be affected. You can also migrate an existing allocation step (as part of a data action) created by referencing a legacy allocation step to one that supports detailed configuration in the data action designer.  Note that creating an allocation process or step using the legacy allocations app, as well as an allocation step (as part of a data action) that references a legacy allocation step, is no longer supported. We recommend using the allocation step in data actions to configure your allocation.  The data action designer now allows you to switch between displaying the ID or description of dimension members from the Display section of the toolbar, to help identify the correct members.  In advanced formulas, with the new configuration function of CONFIG.READ_CALCULATED_MEMBER_VALUES, calculated members, which include non-leaf members, account members with formulas, and calculated measures, can now be defined in and read by RESULTLOOKUP and LINK functions. This configuration function is only supported on SAP Analytics Cloud tenants based on SAP HANA Cloud platform. For details, see CONFIG.READ_CALCULATED_MEMBER_VALUES at About Script Formulas and Calculations in Advanced Formulas for Planning.  In advanced formulas, you can now define a virtual variable member for the version dimension in VARIABLEMEMBER.  In the predictive step of multi actions, you can now use Train Only and Apply Only actions to retrain and apply the predictive model separately. These two new actions come especially handy in what-if simulations, where you can apply the predictive model to different versions with distinct future values for the influencers and produce forecasts, without having to retrain the predictive model multiple times.      Calendar improvements:   As owner of SAP Analytics Cloud calendar events or as assignee of a calendar process, you can now enable the access to your calendar events from external applications. A calendar API allows you to interact with the events in the SAP Analytics Cloud calendar. For details, see Access Calendar Events Using the Calendar API.  As the creator of calendar processes or manual calendar tasks, you can now enable all involved parties to view the events in Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams. For details, see Integrate Your Calendar Events in Microsoft Tools.    Modeling improvements:   The modeler has been extensively redesigned to align with the changes made to models in SAP Analytics Cloud. Models are now more flexible, and you can select how you’d like to build your model. When creating a new model in the Modeler, the application lets you decide whether you want to focus on the data first approach followed by building your model structure, or build your model structure first followed by adding your data. At the heart of this redesign is the new model type, whose capabilities have been extended to offer more flexibility to your modeling workflows. While you can still create classic account models and datasets, we encourage you to try out the new model type to benefit from the latest functionalities available. For more information, check out Get Started with Flexible Modeling, or this blog.   The Data Export API has been extended and now support Public Dimensions. This compliments the Data Import Service API – Master Data Public Dimension, recently released in QRC Q3 2023.  Three new formulas are now available: YearToDate (YTD), QuarterToDate (QTD) and MonthToDate (MTD). These formulas will help modeler and planners perform running totals across time granularities for a given year, quarter, or month.  The Calculations workspace in the modeler now offers an Object Dependency Graph, which provides a graphical representation of object relationships.  The Detail() formula is now deprecated. We strongly recommend replacing this formula in your models with an Exception Aggregation using type SUM and Exception Aggregation Dimension using All Members to see the achieve results. For more information, see: KBA 3235670 - Details () Formula in SAP Analytics Cloud Modeler is Deprecated. For more details on the Data Export API improvements, new formulas and the new dependency graph, check out this blog.     Augmented Analytics improvements:   Just Ask, powered by artificial intelligence, is a natural language query interface used to query data.  Acquired data model support: Classic account and new models.  Initial support of live SAP Datasphere.  Supports queries in English.  Supports copying results to a story and opening data analyzer.    Enhanced accuracy:  Just Ask supports LLM learning enhanced learning with each release.  Automatically infers similar words based on meaning.  Supports customizing synonyms for both metadata and master data.    Enhanced relevancy of query results:   Centrally set searchable models.   Reduces ambiguity when different models include the same names.  Captures user intent through preset rules.      Commenting and Scheduling improvements:   Data point commenting is now supported in models that have role-based data security applied via model privacy. You can comment on data points if you have role-based permissions for multiple read and write permissions on more than one dimension.  You can now use the Include Formatting option while scheduling a publication with the CSV file type and keep the numerical formatting precisely as it appears in the table or chart.  The No End Date option is no longer available.
