The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the first record. The title is \"Changed the default service plan of the autoscaler resource type to standard.\" The description mentions Cloud Foundry, BTP accounts, and trial accounts. Since the entity types don't include technology, I need to represent changes as events. The main event here is the change in the default service plan. The event name should be something like \"AUTOSCALER DEFAULT SERVICE PLAN CHANGE — 2025-02-20\" using the Valid as Of date. The description would note the change from lite to standard and the reason.\n\nNext, the second record is about new custom trusts using token-based authentication. The title mentions OpenID Connect (OIDC) and SAP BTP subaccount. Again, this is a change, so an event. The event name could be \"NEW CUSTOM TRUSTS TO TOKEN-BASED AUTH — 2025-02-20\". The description should mention the switch from password-based to token-based for new OIDC trusts, improving security.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. The text mentions SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry, and ABAP, Kyma, Neo, Other environments. But according to the rules, only explicitly mentioned organizations like SAP BTP or Cloud Foundry should be included. However, the user's entity types include organization, but the instructions say not to emit products/services unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. Wait, the note says if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, but here the entity types include organization. Wait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"SAP BTP subaccount\" and \"SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service\". But the instruction says ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned. SAP BTP is a service, but maybe it's considered an organization here. However, the example D had Microsoft Azure as an organization. So maybe SAP BTP is an organization. But the user's examples don't have SAP BTP as an entity. Hmm, maybe I should check if the text explicitly names an organization. The text mentions \"SAP BTP subaccount\" and \"SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service\", but these are services, not organizations. The environments listed are Cloud Foundry, ABAP, Kyma, Neo, Other. Cloud Foundry is a platform, but in the examples, it was treated as part of the event description, not as an entity. Since the user's entity types include organization, but the text doesn't mention a company name like SAP itself, maybe there are no organizations here. So perhaps no organization entities to emit.\n\nFor relationships, the first event (autoscaler plan change) might relate to Cloud Foundry as the environment, but since Cloud Foundry isn't an entity in the output (unless it's considered an organization, which I'm not sure), maybe no relationships. The second event (token-based auth) involves SAP BTP subaccount, but again, if that's not an entity, no relationships. So maybe no relationships to emit.\n\nSo the final output would be two events with their descriptions, and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOSCALER DEFAULT SERVICE PLAN CHANGE — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>Default autoscaler MTA resource plan changed from LITE to STANDARD for BTP accounts; LITE requires explicit configuration<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CUSTOM TRUSTS TO TOKEN-BASED AUTH — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>New OIDC trusts use token-based authentication instead of password-based for SAP BTP subaccounts<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926124, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 822, "prompt_tokens": 3024, "total_tokens": 3846, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.204983544898916, "duration": 25.524}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

The change aims to ease the consumption of the free standard service plan which is available by default in all BTP accounts, unlike the lite service plan which is available only in trial accounts.  Action: If you need to create Autoscaler service instances with plan lite, set the MTA resource parameter service-plan to lite.\nAction: Recommended\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-02-10\nValid as Of: 2025-02-20\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1350 ---\nComponent: Authorization and Trust Management Service\nEnvironment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other\nTitle: New Custom Trusts for Business Users Changed to Token-Based Authentication\nDescription: With this release, new OpenID Connect (OIDC) trust configurations between your SAP BTP subaccount and a custom identity provider are configured to use token-based authentication instead of password-based.
