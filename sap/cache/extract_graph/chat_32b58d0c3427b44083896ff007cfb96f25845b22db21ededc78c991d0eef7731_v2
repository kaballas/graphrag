The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP release notes based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. Since the text mentions Joule and various SAP modules, but no specific organizations beyond what's in the examples, I need to check if any organizations are mentioned. The examples included Microsoft Azure, so maybe looking for similar mentions here.\n\nLooking at the records, the first one is Record 81. The title is \"New and Upgraded Use Cases Now Supported in SAP SuccessFactors\". The description talks about new use cases and upgrades. According to the steps, whenever there's a release, upgrade, or new capability, it's an event. The valid as of date is 2024-12-20. So the event name would be \"NEW AND UPGRADED USE CASES IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-12-20\". The description should mention introducing new use cases and upgrading existing ones.\n\nNext, Record 82 mentions SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. The title is \"New Use Cases Now Supported in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition\". The valid as of date is 2024-12-20. So another event: \"NEW USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2024-12-20\". The description includes navigation to apps and viewing business data for various objects. But since the entity types don't include technology, I shouldn't list the products as entities. Instead, the event itself is the entity.\n\nRecord 83 is about Dispute Management in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. The valid as of is 2024-12-20. Event name: \"NEW USE CASES IN DISPUTE MANAGEMENT FOR CONTRACT ACCOUNTING — 2024-12-20\". Description mentions dispute resolution and payment resolution.\n\nRecord 84: Cross-Area Capabilities in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Valid as of 2024-12-13. Event name: \"NEW USE CASES IN CROSS-AREA CAPABILITIES — 2024-12-13\". Description about displaying product master data.\n\nRecord 85: Procurement and Finance in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Valid as of 2024-12-13. Event name: \"NEW USE CASES IN PROCUREMENT AND FINANCE — 2024-12-13\". Description includes creating purchase requisitions, changing purchase orders, processing invoice reminders.\n\nRecord 86: Product Lifecycle Management. Valid as of 2024-12-13. Event name: \"NEW USE CASES IN PRODUCT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT — 2024-12-13\". Description about bill of material and change records.\n\nRecord 87: Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management. Valid as of 2024-12-13. Event name: \"NEW USE CASES IN ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT — 2024-12-13\". Description about displaying or changing projects, WBS elements, networks.\n\nNow, checking for organizations, GEOs, or persons. The text mentions SAP S/4HANA, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, products aren't entities. Since the entity types here are organization, person, geo, event, and the examples didn't include SAP as an organization, maybe SAP isn't an entity here. The only organization mentioned in the examples was Microsoft Azure, but that's not in this text. So no organizations to extract. GEOs aren't mentioned either. So all entities are events.\n\nNo relationships are mentioned in the text, so no relationships to extract. Each event is standalone. Now, formatting each event as per the example, ensuring the entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and the dates are from \"Valid as Of\" or \"Latest Revision\".\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW AND UPGRADED USE CASES IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-12-20<|>EVENT<|>Introduced new use cases and upgraded transactional cases in SAP SuccessFactors based on conversational experience<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2024-12-20<|>EVENT<|>Added navigation to apps and viewing business data for objects like batch, billing documents, and suppliers in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN DISPUTE MANAGEMENT FOR CONTRACT ACCOUNTING — 2024-12-20<|>EVENT<|>Supported dispute resolution and payment resolution in Dispute Management for Contract Accounting in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN CROSS-AREA CAPABILITIES — 2024-12-13<|>EVENT<|>Enabled display of product master data in Cross-Area capabilities for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN PROCUREMENT AND FINANCE — 2024-12-13<|>EVENT<|>Supported creating purchase requisitions, changing purchase orders, and processing invoice reminders in Procurement and Finance for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN PRODUCT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT — 2024-12-13<|>EVENT<|>Enabled fetching bill of material details and navigating to Maintain Bill of Material app in Product Lifecycle Management for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT — 2024-12-13<|>EVENT<|>Supported displaying/changing projects, WBS elements, and networks in Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921749, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1358, "prompt_tokens": 3541, "total_tokens": 4899, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 36.55942926369632, "duration": 37.145}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
