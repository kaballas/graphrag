First, I need to identify all entities in the given text. The entity types are organization, person, and geo. The text mentions several organizations and events. For example, the Central Institution is an organization. Then, the text says \"Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.\" So, the entities here are Firuzabad, Aurelia, Quintara, Tiruzia, Krohaara, Cashion, Samuel Namara, ALHAMIA PRISON, DURKE BATAGLANI, and Meggie Tazbah. The relationships are between the entities. For example, Samuel Namara was a hostage in Firuzabad. The entities are all the organizations, people, and places mentioned in the text. The relationships are the connections between the entities. The relationships are based on the text, such as \"Samuel Namara was a hostage in Firuzabad\" or \"Quintara brokered the hostage exchange between Firuzabad and Aurelia.\" The relationships are based on the text, and the strength is a number between 1 and 10, with 1 being weak and 10 being very strong.
