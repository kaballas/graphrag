The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records mention components like SAP Build Apps, SAP Task Center, Joule, Kyma Runtime, SAP Document AI, etc., but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. However, looking at the examples, when a new feature is introduced, it's considered an EVENT. \n\nStarting with Record 1141: It's about a new Date field in SAP Build Apps. The title is \"Web & Mobile\" but the description mentions a new component. The valid as of date is 2025-03-27. So, the event name would be \"NEW DATE FIELD IN SAP BUILD APPS — 2025-03-27\" with a description about the new component allowing date-picking.\n\nRecord 1142: New guided tour in SAP Task Center. The event name would be \"NEW GUIDED TOUR IN SAP TASK CENTER — 2025-03-27\" with the description about the tour being available in SAP Companion.\n\nRecord 1143: New property for extending pull period in SAP Task Center. Event name: \"NEW PROPERTY FOR EXTENDING MAXIMUM PULL PERIOD — 2025-03-27\", description about the tc.inbox.pull.days property.\n\nRecord 1144: Release notes in SAP Task Center Administration app. Event name: \"RELEASE NOTES IN SAP TASK CENTER ADMIN APP — 2025-03-27\", description about release notes being available in the admin app.\n\nRecord 1145: Creating insights cards with Joule in SAP S/4HANA. Event name: \"CREATING INSIGHTS CARDS WITH JOULE — 2025-03-26\", description about adding insights cards to My Home.\n\nRecord 1146: New use cases in SAP S/4HANA Cloud for Joule. Event name: \"JOULE USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD — 2025-03-26\", listing the business objects.\n\nRecord 1147: New use cases in SAP SuccessFactors for Joule. Event name: \"JOULE USE CASES IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2025-03-26\", mentioning the specific use cases.\n\nRecord 1148: Istio module update in Kyma Runtime. Event name: \"ISTIO MODULE UPDATE TO 1.15.0 — 2025-03-26\", description about the update and configuration changes.\n\nRecord 1149: SAP Document AI in Cloud Found. The environment is \"Cloud Found\" which might be a typo for Cloud Foundry. The title is \"SAP Document AI\" but the description is incomplete. However, since the text is cut off, maybe there's not enough info to create an event here. The user might have intended to include more, but based on the given data, I can't form a valid event. So I'll skip this one.\n\nNow, checking for organizations, geos, or persons. The records mention SAP components like SAP Build Apps, SAP Task Center, Joule, Kyma Runtime, SAP Document AI. But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, we shouldn't emit products as entities. However, in the examples, when a product is part of an event, it's included as part of the event description, not as a separate entity. So, no need to create separate entities for these products unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. For example, Kyma Runtime is part of the Kyma environment, but Kyma itself might be an organization? Wait, Kyma is a product by SAP, so maybe not. The allowed entity types are organization, person, geo, event. Since the products are not organizations, they shouldn't be emitted as entities. \n\nLooking for any organizations mentioned. The records mention SAP components, but the actual organizations would be like SAP itself, but the examples don't include that. The user's examples include Microsoft Azure as an organization. In the given data, there's no mention of other organizations except maybe Kyma Runtime, but that's a product. So, no organizations to extract here.\n\nGeos: None of the records mention specific locations, so no GEO entities.\n\nPersons: No named individuals are mentioned, so no PERSON entities.\n\nSo, all entities are EVENTS. Now, relationships: The examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. But in this case, there are no organizations or geos mentioned, so no relationships to extract. \n\nTherefore, the output will be the list of events without any relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW DATE FIELD IN SAP BUILD APPS — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>New Date field with input component for date-picking in SAP Build Apps Web & Mobile>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW GUIDED TOUR IN SAP TASK CENTER — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>Guided tour for SAP Task Center now available in SAP Companion Web app>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW PROPERTY FOR EXTENDING MAXIMUM PULL PERIOD — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>tc.inbox.pull.days property extends task pull period to 180 days in SAP Task Center>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RELEASE NOTES IN SAP TASK CENTER ADMIN APP — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>SAP Task Center release notes now available in Administration app>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CREATING INSIGHTS CARDS WITH JOULE — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Joule enables insights card creation in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Joule supports viewing business data for inspection methods, projects, and contracts in SAP S/4HANA Cloud>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE USE CASES IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Joule adds use cases for changing position status and working time in SAP SuccessFactors>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ISTIO MODULE UPDATE TO 1.15.0 — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Istio module updated to 1.15.0 with prometheusMerge feature for Kyma Runtime>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926691, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1505, "prompt_tokens": 3936, "total_tokens": 5441, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.01174118347726, "duration": 47.014}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

While Kyma Telemetry supports this scenario, other observability tools rely on the prometheusMerge feature of Istio. Now, you can enable this feature by setting the config.telemetry.metrics.prometheusMerge field in the Istio custom resource (CR).  When enabled, the Istio sidecar running with an application exposes an additional port 15020. This port exposes both the workload’s Istio metrics and the custom metrics, as specified by prometheus.io annotations. Istio automatically rewrites the annotations to direct to the new port, allowing metric collection without mTLS.  To disable this feature for a specific workload, you can use the prometheus.istio.io/merge-metrics: \"false\" annotation.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-03-12\nValid as Of: 2025-03-26\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 1149 ---\nComponent: SAP Document AI\nEnvironment: Cloud Found\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f0157406d777ce8b94ad04bb3c3cecc209c43263dbdb574d644fa5133f21ba53_v2"}
