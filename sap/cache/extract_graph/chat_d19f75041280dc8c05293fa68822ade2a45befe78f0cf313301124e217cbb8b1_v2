The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records mention new features, updates, and changes, these should be events. \n\nLooking at Record 1641: \"New PGP View\" for Edge Integration Cell. The description says a new view is available. That's a new capability, so it's an event. The name would be \"NEW PGP VIEW — 2025-01-11\" with the description about managing keyrings.\n\nRecord 1642: Software Version Update for Edge Integration Cell. Version 8.25.*. This is an event too. Name: \"SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-11\" with the version info.\n\nRecord 1643: Creating a Custom IDoc with a new naming convention. This is a change, so an event. Name: \"CREATING A CUSTOM IDOC — 2025-01-11\" and description about the naming format.\n\nSimilarly, Records 1644 to 1648 are all changes or updates in Integration Advisor. Each title is a feature change, so each becomes an event. For example, \"CREATING A MIG — 2025-01-11\" with the description about selecting nodes.\n\nRecord 1649: Get Detailed Descriptions in Questionnaires. This is a change, so event. Name: \"GET DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS IN QUESTIONNAIRES — 2025-01-11\".\n\nRecord 1650: Software Version Update for Integration Assessment. Another event with the version number.\n\nNow, checking for organizations, but the records don't mention specific companies or services except maybe Cloud Foundry and Neo, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, products/services aren't entities. Since the entity types include organization, but the text doesn't mention specific organizations beyond the environments (Cloud Foundry, Neo), which are environments, not organizations. So no organizations here.\n\nGEO isn't mentioned in any record, so no geo entities. PERSON isn't mentioned either. So all entities are events.\n\nNo relationships are needed because there's no mention of locations, organizations involved, or infrastructure providers. Each event is standalone. So the output will be a list of events without relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW PGP VIEW — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>New PGP view for Edge Integration Cell to manage public and secret keyrings)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Edge Integration Cell updated to version 8.25.* with increment 2412)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CREATING A CUSTOM IDOC — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Custom IDoc creation now supports naming convention: Message Type.IDoc Type.Extension Type)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CREATING A MIG — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>MIG creation from payload now allows selecting specific nodes for qualification)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IMPROVED MAPPING PROPOSAL — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Draft MIGs/MAGs now published to knowledge base alongside active ones)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SIMULATING A MAG — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>MAG editor now shows specific nodes/links for error identification during simulation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>SAP Integration Advisor updated to version 1.95.* with increment 2412)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>VALIDATING A XSLT SNIPPET — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>XSLT validation added in MAG editor with compile-time error messages)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GET DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS IN QUESTIONNAIRES — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Hint icons added to Integration Assessment questionnaires for option details)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Integration Assessment updated to version 1.35.* with increment 2412)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923140, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1041, "prompt_tokens": 3849, "total_tokens": 4890, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.66394728584876, "duration": 31.87}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
