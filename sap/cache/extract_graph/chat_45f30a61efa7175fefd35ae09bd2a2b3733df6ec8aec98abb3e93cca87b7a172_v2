The user provided a text about consuming remote services from SAP S/4HANA Cloud or a mock server in a Full-Stack CAP application, with instructions to follow the SAP BTP Developer's Guide and deploy in SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event.\n\nFirst, I need to extract entities. The text mentions \"SAP S/4HANA Cloud\" and \"SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime\". According to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, products/services shouldn't be entities, but they should be represented as EVENT. However, here the user specified entity_types include organization, so I need to check if these are organizations. SAP S/4HANA Cloud is a product, but SAP BTP is an organization. Wait, the user's entity_types include organization, so maybe SAP BTP is an organization. But the text says \"SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime\" which is part of SAP BTP. However, the rules say if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, but here the entity_types include organization, so maybe SAP BTP is considered an organization. But the user's example D had Microsoft Azure as an organization. So SAP BTP would be an organization. However, the text is about using these services, which might be events. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\" The text here is an announcement about how to consume services, which might be an event. But the text doesn't mention a new capability or release, just instructions. However, the \"Action: Info only\" and \"Lifecycle: General Availability\" might indicate that this is an event. The \"Valid as Of: 2024-08-01\" gives a date. So the event name would be something like \"CONSUME REMOTE SERVICES FROM S/4HANA CLOUD OR MOCK SERVER — 2024-08-01\".\n\nFor entities, \"SAP S/4HANA CLOUD\" is a product, but since the entity_types include organization, but the rules say if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products shouldn't be entities. Wait, the user's entity_types include organization, but the text's line of business is Technology. The rules state: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" But here, the entity_types include organization, so maybe products can be considered as organizations? But SAP S/4HANA Cloud is a product, not an organization. However, SAP BTP is an organization. The text mentions \"SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime\" which is part of SAP BTP. So maybe \"SAP BTP\" is the organization. But the text is about using services from S/4HANA Cloud or a mock server, which are products. But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products shouldn't be entities. However, the user's entity_types include organization, so maybe SAP BTP is an organization. \n\nWait, the user's example D had Microsoft Azure as an organization. So in this case, \"SAP BTP\" would be an organization. The text mentions \"SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime\" which is part of SAP BTP. So the organization is SAP BTP. Then, the event is about consuming services from S/4HANA Cloud or mock server in CAP applications, which is an event. \n\nSo the event entity would be \"CONSUME REMOTE SERVICES FROM S/4HANA CLOUD OR MOCK SERVER — 2024-08-01\" with description about the action. Then, the organization is SAP BTP. \n\nBut the text also mentions \"mock server\", which is a service, but not an organization. So no entity for that. \n\nSo the entities would be the event and SAP BTP as organization. Then, the relationship would be the event involving SAP BTP's infrastructure. \n\nBut the user's example D had relationships between the event and the organization and the geo. Here, the event is related to SAP BTP as the organization. So the relationship would be the event involving SAP BTP's infrastructure. \n\nSo the output would be:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CONSUME REMOTE SERVICES FROM S/4HANA CLOUD OR MOCK SERVER — 2024-08-01<|>EVENT<|>Instructions for consuming remote services from S/4HANA Cloud or mock server in CAP applications using SAP BTP Developer's Guide and deploying in SAP BTP Cloud Foundry Runtime)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing runtime environment for deploying Full-Stack CAP applications)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONSUME REMOTE SERVICES FROM S/4HANA CLOUD OR MOCK SERVER — 2024-08-01<|>SAP BTP<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CONSUME REMOTE SERVICES FROM S/4HANA CLOUD OR MOCK SERVER — 2024-08-01<|>EVENT<|>Instructions for consuming remote services from S/4HANA Cloud or mock server in CAP applications using SAP BTP Developer's Guide and deploying in SAP BTP Cloud Foundry Runtime)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing runtime environment for deploying Full-Stack CAP applications)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONSUME REMOTE SERVICES FROM S/4HANA CLOUD OR MOCK SERVER — 2024-08-01<|>SAP BTP<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925797, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1269, "prompt_tokens": 2796, "total_tokens": 4065, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.03574674341109, "duration": 39.612}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
