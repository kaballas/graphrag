A lot of logic can be executed asynchronously to improve performance. In scenarios where changes of the current LUW are to be communicated remotely, the asynchronous execution is even mandatory to be compliant with the SAP LUW (due to implicit database commits).  We want to simplify and improve the background processing by covering all required qualities like: “exactly once”, “in order”, testability and an integration into the ADT cross trace for better supportability.  In the next step of bgPF the AIF integration and its monitoring capabilities are provided. In addition, \"\"in order\"\" capabilities are supported.
