The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" release notes based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse each record and identify the events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. Since the text mentions Joule, SAP SuccessFactors, Cloud Foundry, and other technical terms, I need to check which of these fit into the allowed entity types.\n\nLooking at the first record: \"Enhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors\" with a valid date of 2024-04-03. This seems like an EVENT. The description talks about changes in user views and image handling. So, the event name would be \"ENHANCEMENTS TO JOULE IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-04-03\" with a description summarizing the changes.\n\nNext, Record 119 mentions new use cases in SAP SuccessFactors. The title is \"New Use Cases Now Supported in SAP SuccessFactors\" with a valid date of 2024-02-07. This is another EVENT. The description lists the new use cases, so the event name would be \"NEW USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-02-07\".\n\nRecord 111 is about Joule Booster, which is a change in the integration setup. The title is \"Joule Booster\" with a valid date of 2024-07-11. This should be an EVENT named \"JOULE BOOSTER — 2024-07-11\" with the description about selecting the SAP SuccessFactors system.\n\nRecord 112 introduces a new document grounding capability. The title is \"New Document Grounding Capability\" with a valid date of 2024-06-24. This is an EVENT: \"NEW DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY — 2024-06-24\".\n\nRecord 113 adds more use cases, so the title \"New Use Cases Now Supported in SAP SuccessFactors\" with a valid date of 2024-06-21 becomes another EVENT: \"NEW USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-06-21\".\n\nRecord 114 mentions new conversational patterns and use cases. The title is \"New Conversational Pattern and Use Cases Now Supported in SAP SuccessFactors\" with a valid date of 2024-05-17. This is an EVENT: \"NEW CONVERSATIONAL PATTERN AND USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-05-17\".\n\nRecord 115 discusses migration to IAS-based multitenancy. The title is \"Migration of Joule Application to IAS based Multitenancy\" with a valid date of 2024-... (though the date is cut off, I'll use the latest revision date if available). The event name would be \"MIGRATION OF JOULE APPLICATION TO IAS BASED MULTITENANCY — [DATE]\".\n\nNow, checking for organizations, geos, or persons. The text mentions SAP SuccessFactors, Cloud Foundry, SAP BTP, Identity Authentication (IAS), and XSUAA. These are organizations or services. However, according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services should be represented as events. Since the entity types include organization, I can include SAP SUCCESSFACTORS, CLOUD FOUNDRY, SAP BTP, IAS, and XSUAA as ORGANIZATION entities.\n\nFor relationships, each event might relate to the organizations involved. For example, the Joule enhancements event relates to SAP SUCCESSFACTORS and CLOUD FOUNDRY. The migration event relates to IAS and XSUAA.\n\nI need to ensure that each entity is correctly capitalized and that descriptions are under 25 words. Relationships should be between events and organizations or geos, with strength between 1-10. Since there are no geos mentioned, only organizations, the relationships will be between events and the relevant organizations.\n\nFinally, compiling all entities and relationships in the required format, ensuring no invalid entities are included and that all relationships are valid.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO JOULE IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-04-03<|>EVENT<|>Enhancements to Joule features; inactive users removed from results; default image applied for oversized uploads)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-02-07<|>EVENT<|>SAP SuccessFactors now supports approve spot award, clock in/out, view pay statements, and related use cases)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE BOOSTER — 2024-07-11<|>EVENT<|>Joule booster now allows selecting SAP SuccessFactors system via integration registration instead of manual URL entry)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY — 2024-06-24<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports adding document-based context to queries in SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-06-21<|>EVENT<|>SAP SuccessFactors now supports 17 transactional and 1 navigational use cases for approvals and views)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CONVERSATIONAL PATTERN AND USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>Joule adds 25 transactional and 40 navigational use cases for SAP SuccessFactors)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MIGRATION OF JOULE APPLICATION TO IAS BASED MULTITENANCY — 2024-07-11<|>EVENT<|>Joule now uses SAP Identity Authentication (IAS) for multitenancy; SAML support phased out)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Human capital management software platform integrated with Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud application platform for deploying and managing SAP solutions)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP’s cloud platform for integrating systems and managing identities)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION (IAS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP’s identity and access management service replacing XSUAA for Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>XSUAA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP’s legacy identity and access management service for cloud applications)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO JOULE IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-04-03<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>Event involves SAP SuccessFactors platform<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO JOULE IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-04-03<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Event occurs on Cloud Foundry environment<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-02-07<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>Event involves SAP SuccessFactors platform<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE BOOSTER — 2024-07-11<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>Event involves SAP SuccessFactors integration<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE BOOSTER — 2024-07-11<|>SAP BTP<|>Event requires SAP BTP system registration<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY — 2024-06-24<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>Event involves SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-06-21<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>Event involves SAP SuccessFactors platform<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW CONVERSATIONAL PATTERN AND USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-05-17<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>Event involves SAP SuccessFactors platform<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MIGRATION OF JOULE APPLICATION TO IAS BASED MULTITENANCY — 2024-07-11<|>SAP IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION (IAS)<|>Event involves IAS multitenancy migration<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>MIGRATION OF JOULE APPLICATION TO IAS BASED MULTITENANCY — 2024-07-11<|>XSUAA<|>Event replaces XSUAA with IAS trust configuration<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926937, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2059, "prompt_tokens": 3908, "total_tokens": 5967, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.16333161503976, "duration": 64.017}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Joule now requires a trust configuration of type OpenID Connect with your Identity Authentication tenant. SAML-trusted IdPs for Joule will be supported for a short period after which the trust configuration of type OpenID Connect will be required.  If you are using SAML-trusted IdPs for Joule, you need to change the SAML trust configuration to an OIDC configuration. For more information, see Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect Trust with Identity Authentication.   Ensure that you have configured the trusted domains in Identity Authentication as described in Configure Trusted Domains in Identity Authentication.Note  No action is needed if you are using OIDC trust set up for Joule.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4b246d604e25bdd47af1b0247be3a7956b14e1162562ec4379278e2610218765_v2"}
