In buildless mode, Function code and dependencies are injected directly into Kyma-provided runtime images at Pod startup.  You can toggle on or off buildless mode by changing the Serverless configuration and choosing the best approach for your use case. For more details, see Serverless Buildless Mode.  Starting with the 1.9.0 release, buildless mode will be switched on by default, with the option to disable it manually. From the 2.0.0 version, buildless mode will be the only available option.  Localizable Serverless Images:Serverless runtime images can now be localized, enabling deployment in environments with restricted or private registries.  This enhancement improves flexibility and compliance for enterprise and regulated workloads.  Dedicated Network Policies:With version 1.8.0, users can enable dedicated Serverless network policies. This ensures Serverless remains functional on clusters with restrictive, deny-all network policies, improving security and compatibility for enterprise environments.  Deprecations/Breaking changes:The following fields, that were deprecated in the Serverless 1.6.0 release are no longer functional in buildless mode:    Function CRD  spec.scaleConfig – For existing Functions with scaleConfig defined, the HorizontalPodAutoscaler objects are not deleted upon switching to buildless mode, but are no longer\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AVAILABILITY SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Availability Service provides a unified interface for exploring and managing resources, offering a refreshed look and streamlined workflow)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud Foundry is a platform involved in various cloud services and updates, including Availability Service, Cloud Logging, and others)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD LOGGING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud Logging is a service that provides updates for OpenSearch and OpenTelemetry index patterns, improving traceability and stacktrace display)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KYMA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kyma is a runtime platform involved in updates like OpenSearch, Keda module, and Serverless module enhancements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP COCKPIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP BTP Cockpit offers enhanced cost transparency with direct access to the SAP Price List and monitoring tools for usage and consumption costs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud Transport Management provides modifiable transport requests with UI enhancements for SAP cloud changes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM DOMAIN SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Custom Domain Service enables SaaS routes for applications with SAP Identity Service-based user authentication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KYMA RUNTIME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kyma Runtime includes updates to Keda and Serverless modules, improving deployment in regulated environments and enhancing security and compliance)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AVAILABILITY SERVICE<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Availability Service is part of the Cloud Foundry platform<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD LOGGING<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Cloud Logging is a service under the Cloud Foundry platform<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD LOGGING<|>KYMA<|>Cloud Logging collaborates with Kyma for OpenSearch and OpenTelemetry updates<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP BTP COCKPIT<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>SAP BTP Cockpit integrates with Cloud Foundry for cost transparency and monitoring<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Cloud Transport Management is part of the Cloud Foundry ecosystem<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUSTOM DOMAIN SERVICE<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Custom Domain Service operates within the Cloud Foundry platform<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYMA RUNTIME<|>KYMA<|>Kyma Runtime is a component of the Kyma platform, focusing on Keda and Serverless updates<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
