The user provided some data from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The text has two records. The first one is about a Software Version Update for Edge Integration Cell in Cloud Foundry. The second is about Integration Advisor in Cloud Foundry and Neo environments. \n\nLooking at the entity types allowed: organization, person, geo, event. The instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities but represented as events. However, in the examples, when TECHNOLOGY was mentioned, they created events. Wait, the user's note says that when TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed entity types, don't emit products/services/environments as entities. But here, the entity types include organization, etc., so maybe Cloud Foundry and Neo are environments, which are part of the TECHNOLOGY category. But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, we shouldn't emit them. However, in the examples, like Example D, Microsoft Azure was an organization. So maybe Cloud Foundry and Neo are considered organizations? Wait, the user's examples have \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as an organization. So perhaps Cloud Foundry and Neo are considered organizations here. But the user's instruction says that if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products/services/environments. But in this case, the entity types include organization, so maybe Cloud Foundry and Neo are considered organizations. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" But in this case, the entity types include organization, so maybe Cloud Foundry and Neo are considered organizations. However, the user's examples have \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as an organization. So perhaps Cloud Foundry and Neo are considered organizations here. \n\nBut looking at the first record: \"Environment: Cloud Foundry\" and \"Component: Edge Integration Cell\". The title is \"Software Version Update\". The description mentions Edge Integration Cell version 8.31.* and increment 2505. The action is Info only, lifecycle General Availability, type New, line of business Technology, valid as of 2025-07-06. \n\nSince the entity types include organization, and Cloud Foundry is an environment, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, we shouldn't emit products/services/environments. However, in the examples, when TECHNOLOGY was part of the text, they created events. Wait, the user's instruction says that if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed entity types, then products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted. But in this case, the allowed entity types include organization, so maybe Cloud Foundry is considered an organization. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Cloud Foundry is a product/service, and since TECHNOLOGY is part of the line of business, but the entity types don't include TECHNOLOGY, so we shouldn't emit it as an entity. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" So if the entity types don't include TECHNOLOGY, then products/services/environments are not emitted as entities. But in this case, the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. So TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed entity types. Therefore, products/services/environments (like Cloud Foundry, Neo) should not be emitted as entities. Instead, the changes should be represented as EVENT entities. \n\nSo for the first record, the title is \"Software Version Update\" for Edge Integration Cell. Since Edge Integration Cell is a product/service, and TECHNOLOGY is not an allowed entity type, we shouldn't emit it as an entity. Instead, create an EVENT entity. The event name would be \"SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-07-06\" (using the valid as of date). The description would be \"Software version update for Edge Integration Cell; version 8.31.*; increment 2505.\" \n\nSimilarly, the second record is about Integration Advisor in Cloud Foundry and Neo. Again, Integration Advisor is a product/service, and since TECHNOLOGY isn't an allowed entity type, we don't emit it as an entity. Instead, create an EVENT entity: \"INTEGRATION ADVISOR SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-07-06\" with description \"Software version update for SAP Integration Advisor; version 2.1.*; increment 2505.\" \n\nNow, check if there are any organizations, persons, geos. The text mentions Cloud Foundry and Neo, but since they are products/services and TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, they aren't emitted as entities. So no organizations, persons, or geos here. \n\nFor relationships, since there are no entities other than the events, there are no relationships to emit. \n\nSo the output would be two EVENT entities and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-07-06<|>EVENT<|>Software version update for Edge Integration Cell; version 8.31.*; increment 2505)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATION ADVISOR SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-07-06<|>EVENT<|>Software version update for SAP Integration Advisor; version 2.1.*; increment 2505)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925274, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1212, "prompt_tokens": 2844, "total_tokens": 4056, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 33.66386134488793, "duration": 36.003}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
