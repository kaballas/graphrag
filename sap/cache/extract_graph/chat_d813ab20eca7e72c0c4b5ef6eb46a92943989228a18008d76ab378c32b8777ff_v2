The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records are about Cloud Identity Services, Identity Provisioning, Kyma Runtime, and Pricing Service, which are products or services, but the instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, these should be represented as EVENT entities. Wait, the user's entity types include EVENT, so maybe those product names can be part of the event description but not as entities themselves. Wait, the rules say: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" But in the current case, the entity_types provided by the user include EVENT, so maybe the products are part of the event description.\n\nLooking at the first record, Record 791: The title is \"Cloud Identity Services Documentation\" and the description mentions that the Version column now contains version numbers instead of sprint numbers. This seems like an announcement or a change, so it should be an EVENT. The event name would be something like \"CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES DOCUMENTATION UPDATE — 2025-05-21\" with a description about the version column change.\n\nRecord 792: Password Management feature added. This is a new feature, so an EVENT. Name: \"PASSWORD MANAGEMENT FEATURE ADDITION — 2025-05-21\", description about configuring password expiration reminders.\n\nRecord 793: Regular Upgrade. This is a general upgrade, so EVENT. Name: \"CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES UPGRADE — 2025-05-21\", description stating the service was upgraded.\n\nRecord 794: SAML 2.0 Configuration change. The Name field changed to Entity ID. EVENT: \"SAML 2.0 CONFIGURATION CHANGE — 2025-05-21\", description about the field name change.\n\nRecord 795: Support for SAP extension schema for groups in Cloud Identity Services. EVENT: \"SAP EXTENSION SCHEMA SUPPORT FOR GROUPS — 2025-05-21\", mentioning the connectors and SAP products.\n\nRecord 796: Similar to 795 but for Identity Provisioning. EVENT: \"SAP EXTENSION SCHEMA SUPPORT FOR GROUPS — 2025-05-21\" (but need to check if the component is different. Since the component is Identity Provisioning, maybe the event name should include that. Wait, the title is \"Support for SAP extension schema for groups\" under Identity Provisioning. So the event name would be \"SAP EXTENSION SCHEMA SUPPORT FOR GROUPS IN IDENTITY PROVISIONING — 2025-05-21\".\n\nRecord 797: Kyma Runtime allows Auto Scaler Max to 1. EVENT: \"KYMARUNTIME AUTO SCALER CONFIGURATION CHANGE — 2025-05-21\", description about scaling down and cost reduction.\n\nRecord 798: Pricing Service extension concept. EVENT: \"PRICING SERVICE EXTENSION BUFFERING DISABLE — 2025-05-21\", description about disabling buffering via Cache-Control.\n\nRecord 799: Fix for variant condition field in Pricing Service. EVENT: \"PRICING SERVICE VARIANT CONDITION FIX — 2025-05-21\", description about the correction in handling condition keys.\n\nNow, checking for organizations, geos, or persons. The records mention SAP products and services, but the allowed entity types don't include TECHNOLOGY as an entity. So products like Cloud Identity Services, Kyma Runtime, Pricing Service are not emitted as entities but are part of the event descriptions. The only possible organizations mentioned are SAP's products, but according to the rules, products/services aren't entities unless they are explicitly named as organizations. However, the examples like Example A include DigiCert as an organization. In the given data, there's no mention of external organizations, so maybe no organizations to extract. Similarly, no geos or persons are mentioned. Therefore, all entities would be events.\n\nEach event needs to be formatted with the name in uppercase, type EVENT, and a description. Then, check for relationships. Since there are no organizations, geos, or persons mentioned, there are no relationships to emit. So the output will be a list of events with no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES DOCUMENTATION UPDATE — 2025-05-21<|>EVENT<|>Version column now displays version numbers instead of sprint numbers in What's New documentation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PASSWORD MANAGEMENT FEATURE ADDITION — 2025-05-21<|>EVENT<|>Configure password expiration reminders at sign-in page for user accounts)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES UPGRADE — 2025-05-21<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services have been upgraded to latest version)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAML 2.0 CONFIGURATION CHANGE — 2025-05-21<|>EVENT<|>Name field renamed to Entity ID in SAML 2.0 configuration at application level)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP EXTENSION SCHEMA SUPPORT FOR GROUPS — 2025-05-21<|>EVENT<|>Connectors support SAP extension schema attributes for groups across multiple SAP applications)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP EXTENSION SCHEMA SUPPORT FOR GROUPS IN IDENTITY PROVISIONING — 2025-05-21<|>EVENT<|>Identity Provisioning connectors support SAP extension schema attributes for groups)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KYMARUNTIME AUTO SCALER CONFIGURATION CHANGE — 2025-05-21<|>EVENT<|>Additional worker node pools allow Auto Scaler Min=0 and Max=1 for cost reduction)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRICING SERVICE EXTENSION BUFFERING DISABLE — 2025-05-21<|>EVENT<|>Disable local extension call buffering via manifest file parameter caching: false)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRICING SERVICE VARIANT CONDITION FIX — 2025-05-21<|>EVENT<|>Corrected handling of variant condition keys with empty condition records in pricing)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923269, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1438, "prompt_tokens": 3953, "total_tokens": 5391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.822057883684835, "duration": 43.812}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
