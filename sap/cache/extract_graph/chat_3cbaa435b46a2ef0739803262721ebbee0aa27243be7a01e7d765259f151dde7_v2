The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and check if they qualify for creating EVENT entities. The instructions say that whenever there's a release, upgrade, new feature, etc., we should create an EVENT. Also, products/services shouldn't be entities unless they're explicitly mentioned as organizations. \n\nLooking at Record 1651: It's a survey for documentation improvement. That's more of an announcement, not a new feature or change, so maybe not an event. \n\nRecord 1652: Effort Estimation Data in Scenario Evaluation Reports. This is a new feature, so that's an EVENT. The title can be \"EFFORT ESTIMATION DATA IN SCENARIO EVALUATION REPORTS — 2025-01-11\" with a description about accessing effort data in exports.\n\nRecord 1653: Performance Data for Integration Scenarios. Another new feature, so EVENT. Title would be \"PERFORMANCE DATA FOR INTEGRATION SCENARIOS — 2025-01-11\" with details on message sizes and processing times.\n\nRecord 1654: Software Version Update for Migration Assessment. This is a version change, so EVENT. Title: \"MIGRATION ASSESSMENT SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-11\" with the version number.\n\nRecord 1655: Archive Sender/Receiver Interchange Payloads. A new configuration option, so EVENT. Title: \"ARCHIVE SENDER/RECEIVER INTERCHANGE PAYLOADS — 2025-01-11\" and description about configuring archive settings.\n\nRecord 1656: Software Version Update for SAP Cloud Integration. Another version change, EVENT. Title: \"SAP CLOUD INTEGRATION SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-11\".\n\nRecord 1657: Support for CMIS Search Attributes. New feature, EVENT. Title: \"SUPPORT FOR CMIS SEARCH ATTRIBUTES — 2025-01-11\" with details on searchable fields.\n\nRecord 1658: CI/CD Overview Page Removed. This is a deletion, so EVENT. Title: \"CI/CD OVERVIEW PAGE REMOVAL — 2025-01-10\" with info about the page being moved.\n\nRecord 1659: API Gateway module update. This is a change in Kyma Runtime, so EVENT. Title: \"API GATEWAY MODULE UPDATE TO VERSION 1.10.2 — 2025-01-10\".\n\nRecord 1660: Option to Deactivate/Activate monitors. New feature, EVENT. Title: \"OPTION TO DEACTIVATE/ACTIVATE MONITORS — 2025-01-09\".\n\nNow, checking for organizations, but the records don't mention specific companies except maybe SAP Cloud Integration, but according to the rules, products aren't entities unless explicitly named as organizations. Since the entity types don't include technology, I shouldn't list products as organizations. So no ORGANIZATION entities here. \n\nGEO isn't mentioned in any records, so no GEO entities. PERSON isn't mentioned either. \n\nRelationships: Since there are no organizations or geos involved in these events, there are no relationships to extract. \n\nSo the output will be the list of EVENT entities without any relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>EFFORT ESTIMATION DATA IN SCENARIO EVALUATION REPORTS — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Access effort estimation data in scenario evaluation spreadsheet exports for Migration Assessment<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>PERFORMANCE DATA FOR INTEGRATION SCENARIOS — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Export performance details like message sizes and processing times for integration scenarios<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>MIGRATION ASSESSMENT SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Migration Assessment updated to version 1.35.* with increment 2412<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>ARCHIVE SENDER/RECEIVER INTERCHANGE PAYLOADS — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Configure bulk archive settings for sender/receiver interchange payloads in Trading Partner Management<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP CLOUD INTEGRATION SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Integration updated to version 6.61.* with increment 2412<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORT FOR CMIS SEARCH ATTRIBUTES — 2025-01-11<|>EVENT<|>Enable CMIS search attributes for archived B2B payloads in Trading Partner Management<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>CI/CD OVERVIEW PAGE REMOVAL — 2025-01-10<|>EVENT<|>CI/CD overview page removed from SAP Help Portal; information relocated to product page<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>API GATEWAY MODULE UPDATE TO VERSION 1.10.2 — 2025-01-10<|>EVENT<|>Kyma Runtime API Gateway module updated to version 1.10.2 with performance improvements<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>OPTION TO DEACTIVATE/ACTIVATE MONITORS — 2025-01-09<|>EVENT<|>Availability Service allows temporary deactivation/reactivation of monitor executions<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925490, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1255, "prompt_tokens": 3941, "total_tokens": 5196, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.827749740052244, "duration": 39.431}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
