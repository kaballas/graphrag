The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records are about new features, changes, and enhancements, they should be considered events.\n\nLooking at Record 2921: The title is \"SAP Logo as favIcon for the SAP Fiori Launchpad.\" The description mentions changing the favIcon. This is a new feature, so an event. The entity name would be \"SAP LOGO AS FAVICON FOR SAP FIORI LAUNCHPAD — 2024-05-17\" with the event type. The description should mention the change from Fiori flower to SAP logo and the ability to change via the theme designer.\n\nRecord 2922: \"Set the AIR-Key as Custom HTTP Header Field.\" This is a change in functionality. The event name would be \"AIR-KEY AS CUSTOM HTTP HEADER FIELD — 2024-05-17.\" The description should note the ability to set AIR key as a custom header for asynchronous SOAP calls.\n\nRecord 2923: \"SQL-based Remote Access from SAP HANA Cloud Databases to ABAP Systems.\" This is a new feature. The event name would be \"SQL-BASED REMOTE ACCESS FROM SAP HANA CLOUD TO ABAP SYSTEMS — 2024-05-17.\" The description should mention the support for SQL-based access to CDS views.\n\nRecord 2924: \"Subentities as Authorization Master.\" New feature allowing subentities as authorization masters. Event name: \"SUBENTITIES AS AUTHORIZATION MASTER — 2024-05-17.\" Description about defining non-root entities as authorization masters.\n\nRecord 2925: \"Technical Monitoring: Table Analysis.\" New monitoring feature. Event name: \"TABLE ANALYSIS FOR TECHNICAL MONITORING — 2024-05-17.\" Description about analyzing table statistics with filters and details.\n\nRecord 2926: \"Job Sorting by Latest Build.\" New sorting option in Jobs overview. Event name: \"JOB SORTING BY LATEST BUILD — 2024-05-17.\" Description about sorting jobs by latest build.\n\nRecord 2927: Features for SAP Analytics Cloud 2024 QRC 2. This is a new version release. Event name: \"SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD 2024 QRC 2 FEATURES — 2024-05-17.\" Description should mention the new features like stories improvements, UI changes, etc.\n\nNow, check for organizations, geos, or other entities. The records mention SAP HANA Cloud, ABAP Environment, SAP BTP, SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Help Portal, SAP UI Theme Designer. However, according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities. But in the examples, sometimes they are part of the event description. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" Since the entity types here include organization, and the records mention SAP HANA Cloud, ABAP Environment, etc., which are products/services, but the user's entity types include organization. However, the rule says if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, don't emit them. Wait, the user's entity_types in the real data are organization, person, geo, event. The records mention SAP HANA Cloud, ABAP Environment, SAP BTP, SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Help Portal. These are products or services, not organizations. So according to the rules, since they are not organizations, they shouldn't be emitted as entities. So only events are emitted here. \n\nSo all the extracted entities are events. No relationships since there's no mention of locations, organizations involved, etc. So the output will be the list of events without relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP LOGO AS FAVICON FOR SAP FIORI LAUNCHPAD — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>SAP Fiori launchpad favIcon changes from Fiori flower to SAP logo; configurable via SAP UI Theme Designer with sapUiShellFavicon parameter)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AIR-KEY AS CUSTOM HTTP HEADER FIELD — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>Enable setting AIR key as custom HTTP header for asynchronous SOAP outbound communication; header resets after web service calls)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SQL-BASED REMOTE ACCESS FROM SAP HANA CLOUD TO ABAP SYSTEMS — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>SAP HANA Cloud now supports SQL-based remote access to ABAP CDS views via ABAP SQL services)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUBENTITIES AS AUTHORIZATION MASTER — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>Authorization master entities can now be defined as non-root entities in ABAP Environment)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE ANALYSIS FOR TECHNICAL MONITORING — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>Guided analysis of table statistics for memory, disk usage, and records with filters by table name, type, or application component)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOB SORTING BY LATEST BUILD — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>Jobs overview table now supports sorting by latest build in Cloud Foundry environment)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD 2024 QRC 2 FEATURES — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>New features in SAP Analytics Cloud 2024 Q2: optimized story experience, member selector redesign, continuous scrolling, wildcard search, and dynamic member exclusion)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925633, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1325, "prompt_tokens": 3924, "total_tokens": 5249, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.251474126138024, "duration": 42.398}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

On the SAP Analytics Cloud product page, you’ll find a complete set of SAP Analytics Cloud guides and resources.  Some highlights include:   Stories improvements:  In the optimized story experience, the filter by member dialog has been redesigned and now provides new features:  Improved UI architecture: The UI layout of the member selector provides direct access to the essential actions and settings, such as the search field and the hierarchy selection. Other settings, like read mode or text presentation, have been moved into a settings panel that can be opened on demand. The multi-column presentation of the selectable members allows for better readability.  Increased flexibility: The dialog box can now be resized, and can be dragged to a different position. The panels are also resizable, and the content of the panels are fully responsive.   Continuous scrolling: The new member selector implements a lazy loading mechanism that applies to the list of selectable members as well as the list of member selections: as you scroll down, members are automatically and continuously loaded at the bottom.  Search hits highlighting: The new member selector bolds each part of a member label that matches the search criteria.  Enhanced search capabilities: The new member selector supports the wildcard search, specifically the wildcard character “*” which replaces zero or more characters.  Enhanced member exclusion paradigm: The new member selector introduces an advanced paradigm for member exclusion: it allows you to deselect one or more descendants of a selected node. For example, select the country “USA” but explicitly exclude the state “Florida”. This selection is dynamic, which means that if, in the data source, a new state is registered under the country “USA”, it is implicitly part of the selection.
