The user provided a set of instructions for extracting entities and relationships from some SAP release notes. The task is to follow the steps outlined in the examples and apply them to the given real data.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The real data has three records (3748, 3749, 3750) under the component \"SAP Build Process Automation\" in the Cloud Foundry environment. Each record has a title, description, and other metadata like Valid as Of date.\n\nThe entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. According to the steps, if the TECHNOLOGY isn't in those types, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. Here, the component is \"SAP Build Process Automation,\" which is a product, but since TECHNOLOGY is not allowed as an entity type, we need to treat these as events.\n\nLooking at each record:\n\nRecord 3748: Title is \"Create and Manage Projects.\" The description mentions user principles being case-insensitive. This seems like a change, so an EVENT entity. The name would be \"USER PRINCIPLES CASE INSENSITIVITY — 2023-12-12\" with a description about case insensitivity in user principles.\n\nRecord 3749: Title is \"Different Types of Set Activity Options in the Enhanced Recorder.\" The description adds new options for modifying input values. This is a new feature, so another EVENT. The name could be \"NEW SET ACTIVITY OPTIONS IN ENHANCED RECORDER — 2023-12-12\" with a description about the new options.\n\nRecord 3750: Title is \"Error Management in the Enhanced Recorder.\" The description introduces error management features. This is also a new feature, so another EVENT. The name would be \"ERROR MANAGEMENT IN ENHANCED RECORDER — 2023-12-12\" with a description about managing errors during recording.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations or locations. However, in these records, there's no mention of specific organizations, people, or geographic locations. The component is a product, but since we can't emit products as entities (as TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed), there are no relationships to form. So, no relationships will be emitted.\n\nEach entity is formatted with uppercase names and types. Descriptions are concise, under 25 words. No invalid entities are present. The output should list all three events followed by no relationships, ending with <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>USER PRINCIPLES CASE INSENSITIVITY — 2023-12-12<|>EVENT<|>User principles now treated as case-insensitive in SAP Build Process Automation projects)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW SET ACTIVITY OPTIONS IN ENHANCED RECORDER — 2023-12-12<|>EVENT<|>Enhanced recorder now supports converting inputs to variables, replacing variables with original inputs, and replacing inputs with existing variables)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ERROR MANAGEMENT IN ENHANCED RECORDER — 2023-12-12<|>EVENT<|>Enhanced recorder now includes error management capabilities during recording processes)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925485, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 702, "prompt_tokens": 3094, "total_tokens": 3796, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.8859011627907, "duration": 22.016}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
