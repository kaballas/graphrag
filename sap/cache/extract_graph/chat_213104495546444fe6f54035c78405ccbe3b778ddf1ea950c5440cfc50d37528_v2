If you make use of this on-premise token retrieval functionality and if the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does not support IPv6, no action is needed, as the IPv4 addresses are unaffected.   If the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does support IPv6, then the Java virtual machine will usually prefer to use IPv4 instead of IPv6 (usually controlled via the java.net.preferIPv6Addresses system property). If this is the case for your Java virtual machine, again, no action is needed.   Required Action:  If your JVM is configured to prefer IPv6, you need to verify if you have firewall rules in place that limit outgoing traffic from the network. If that is the case, you would have previously allowed the certain IPv4 addresses to enable the Cloud Connector’s communication with BTP. Now, you need to add also the IPv6 addresses to the allowlist.    Note  As of version 2.18.1, the Cloud Connector shows the IPv6 status on the About screen.    The Destination service egress IPs are the ones on behalf of which external resources are accessed either via Check Connection or automatic token retrieval for an Internet destination. In some cases, you might have an allowlist for IPs at the target system. If that is the case, please add the IPv6 addresses of the Destination service to the list.  For more information, see Configure Destination Service IPs in Firewall Rules.
