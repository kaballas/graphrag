To learn about new features, bug fixes, and changes in this release, read the Istio 1.27 release announcement and Upgrade Notes.Caution  Since version 1.27, Istio injects the Istio proxy as an init container by default. In this release, the Istio module's operator disables this behavior to maintain compatibility. Disabling this behavior is a temporary measure and will be removed with Istio module 1.22. After this, sidecar proxies will be injected as init containers by default. For more information, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  The Istio module now supports installation with Istio images injected into the installer from environment variables. This allows for more flexible deployments, especially in environments where images are not available in a public registry. See issue #1519.  Additionally, this release contains the following bug fixes:  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource.
