The user provided a text with two records and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps. First, I need to parse the text and identify the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the first record (Record 49), the title is \"Documentation update only: Do Not Use Standard Users for Web Services.\" The description mentions that standard users shouldn't be used for web services. According to the steps, I need to create an EVENT entity for any release, upgrade, fix, etc. The valid as of date is 2025-09-25, so the event name would be \"DO NOT USE STANDARD USERS FOR WEB SERVICES — 2025-09-25.\" The description should mention the update in User Administration and the recommendation against using standard users.\n\nNext, the second record (Record 50) talks about the end of support for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. The event here is the end of support, valid as of 2025-09-25. The event name would be \"END OF SUPPORT FOR AZURE DATA LAKE STORAGE GEN1 — 2025-09-25.\" The description should note that SAP is ending support in an early 2026 release and recommend using ADLS Gen2.\n\nNow, checking for entities. The first event doesn't mention any organizations, people, or geos, so no entities there. The second event mentions Microsoft and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1. Microsoft is an organization, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 is a product, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity type, I can't include it. However, the event itself is about the end of support, which is an EVENT. Wait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. So, Microsoft is an organization. The event is about Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, but since that's a product, it's not an entity. So, the only entity here is Microsoft as the organization. But the event is about the end of support, which is an EVENT. So, the event entity would be \"END OF SUPPORT FOR AZURE DATA LAKE STORAGE GEN1 — 2025-09-25\" and the relationship would link it to Microsoft, as the event involves Microsoft's decision to end support. The relationship description would be \"Event involves organization's infrastructure\" with a strength of maybe 8.\n\nWait, but the user's instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities. So, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 is a product, so it's not an entity. Only Microsoft (organization) is valid. The event is about the end of support, which is an EVENT. So, the entities would be the two events and Microsoft as an organization. Then, the relationships would link the second event to Microsoft.\n\nLet me check the steps again. For the second record, the event is the end of support for ADLS Gen1. The description says Microsoft ended support in 2024, and SAP will follow in 2026. So, the event is about SAP ending support, but the reason is Microsoft's action. However, the event is an SAP-related event, so the entity would be the event itself, and the relationship would be with Microsoft as the organization involved. The relationship description could be \"Event involves organization's infrastructure\" with strength 8.\n\nSo, the output should have two events and one organization (Microsoft). Then, the relationships between the second event and Microsoft.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DO NOT USE STANDARD USERS FOR WEB SERVICES — 2025-09-25<|>EVENT<|>User Administration updated to advise against using standard users for web services>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>END OF SUPPORT FOR AZURE DATA LAKE STORAGE GEN1 — 2025-09-25<|>EVENT<|>SAP ends support for ADLS Gen1 in 2026 release; recommends ADLS Gen2>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Technology company providing Azure Data Lake Storage services>)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>END OF SUPPORT FOR AZURE DATA LAKE STORAGE GEN1 — 2025-09-25<|>MICROSOFT<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926860, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 948, "prompt_tokens": 2983, "total_tokens": 3931, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.940700808625337, "duration": 29.68}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
