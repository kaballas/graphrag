The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The instructions say to create EVENT entities for releases, upgrades, new capabilities, etc. \n\nLooking at Record 3257: SAPUI5 Distribution 1.122 has been released. The valid as of date is 2024-03-21. So the event name would be \"SAPUI5 DISTRIBUTION 1.122 — 2024-03-21\". The description mentions the release for UI development and consumption by SAP BTP services. I need to make sure the description is under 25 words. \n\nNext, Record 3258: Custom Domains in Cloud Identity Services. The valid as of is 2024-03-20. The event name would be \"CUSTOM DOMAINS — 2024-03-20\". The description is about adding a deprecation trial token for third-party cookies. \n\nRecord 3259: Off-Cycle Upgrade for Identity Authentication. Valid as of 2024-03-20. Event name \"OFF-CYCLE UPGRADE — 2024-03-20\". Description states the upgrade has been done. \n\nRecord 3260: Guided Answers for Pricing Service. Valid as of 2024-03-20. Event name \"GUIDED ANSWERS FOR THE PRICING SERVICE — 2024-03-20\". Description mentions the first version of a public troubleshooting guide.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. SAP BTP is mentioned in Record 3257. Also, Cloud Foundry, Kyma, Neo are environments, but the entity types don't include technology, so they shouldn't be emitted as entities. However, the instruction says if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, represent changes as EVENT. Since the entity types here include organization, but the environments are part of the environment list, maybe SAP BTP is an organization. \n\nWait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The instruction says if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products/services/environments as entities. But in the examples, like Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So in Record 3257, SAP BTP is mentioned as a service provider, so it's an organization. \n\nSo for the event in Record 3257, the relationship would be between the event and SAP BTP, as the event involves SAP BTP services. Similarly, other events might relate to Cloud Identity Services or Pricing Service, but those are products, not organizations. Wait, the instruction says not to emit products/services as entities unless they are organizations. So maybe only SAP BTP is an organization here. \n\nLooking at the relationships: each event might be related to the organization (SAP BTP) or the service (like Cloud Identity Services). But since services aren't allowed as entities unless they are organizations, perhaps only SAP BTP is an organization. \n\nSo for the first event (SAPUI5 1.122), the relationship would be between the event and SAP BTP, as the event involves SAP BTP services. The strength would be around 9. \n\nFor the other events, like Custom Domains in Cloud Identity Services, since Cloud Identity Services isn't an organization, there's no relationship to emit. Similarly for Off-Cycle Upgrade and Guided Answers for Pricing Service. \n\nSo the entities would be the four events and SAP BTP as an organization. Then relationships between the first event and SAP BTP. The other events don't have organizations to link to. \n\nI need to make sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are only between valid entities. Also, check for any GEOs or PERSONs, but the text doesn't mention any. \n\nSo the final output should list the four events and SAP BTP as an organization, then the relationship between the first event and SAP BTP.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SAPUI5 DISTRIBUTION 1.122 — 2024-03-21<|>EVENT<|>SAPUI5 version 1.122 released for UI development; available for SAP BTP services consumption)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM DOMAINS — 2024-03-20<|>EVENT<|>Add deprecation trial token for 3rd party cookies in custom domains for Identity Authentication)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>OFF-CYCLE UPGRADE — 2024-03-20<|>EVENT<|>Identity Authentication service upgraded to new version in Cloud Foundry/Kyma/Neo environments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GUIDED ANSWERS FOR THE PRICING SERVICE — 2024-03-20<|>EVENT<|>Public troubleshooting guide published for Pricing Service consumers via LOD-CPS-PRC)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform enabling consumption of SAPUI5 1.122 by services)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAPUI5 DISTRIBUTION 1.122 — 2024-03-21<|>SAP BTP<|>Event involves platform services consuming the UI framework<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925921, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1212, "prompt_tokens": 3177, "total_tokens": 4389, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.48284734133791, "duration": 37.312}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
