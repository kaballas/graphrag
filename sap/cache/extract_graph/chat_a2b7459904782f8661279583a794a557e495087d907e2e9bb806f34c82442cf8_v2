The user provided several records from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records are about changes in SAP Advanced Financial Closing and SAP Analytics Cloud, which are products, but the instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, products should be represented as events. However, looking at the examples, when a product is mentioned without being an organization, it's treated as an event. \n\nStarting with Record 3861: The title is \"Limit for Moving Folders\" and the description mentions increasing the maximum number of folders. This is a change, so it's an event. The valid as of date is 2023-11-12. The event name would be \"LIMIT FOR MOVING FOLDERS — 2023-11-12\" with a description about the folder limit increase.\n\nRecord 3862: \"Predefined Task Filter Changed\" – another change, so event. Valid as of same date. The event name would be \"PREDEFINED TASK FILTER CHANGED — 2023-11-12\" with the description about the filter adjustment.\n\nRecord 3863: \"Send Notifications to Additional Interested Users\" – new feature, so event. The description mentions sending notifications to additional users, so the event name is \"SEND NOTIFICATIONS TO ADDITIONAL INTERESTED USERS — 2023-11-12\" with the relevant description.\n\nRecord 3864: \"System Behavior Changed for Setting Task Lists to Completed\" – another change, event. The event name would be \"SYSTEM BEHAVIOR CHANGED FOR SETTING TASK LISTS TO COMPLETED — 2023-11-12\" with the warning message change.\n\nRecord 3865: \"Translation of Task List Default Descriptions\" – new feature, event. The event name is \"TRANSLATION OF TASK LIST DEFAULT DESCRIPTIONS — 2023-11-12\" with the translation capability.\n\nRecord 3866: \"User Interface Changes for Uploading Attachments\" – change, event. Event name: \"USER INTERFACE CHANGES FOR UPLOADING ATTACHMENTS — 2023-11-12\" with the UI changes.\n\nRecord 3867: \"Features for 2023 QRC 4 (version 2023.24)\" – this is about SAP Analytics Cloud, which is a product. Since the environment is \"Other\" and the entity types don't include technology, this should be an event. The valid as of date is 2023-10-27 (from Latest Revision) but the text mentions the release of Q4 2023. However, the user's example D used \"Valid as Of\" date. The record's \"Valid as Of\" is 2023-11-12, but the description says \"release of SAP Analytics Cloud Q4 2023\". The date in the text might be 2023-10-27 (Latest Revision) but the actual release is Q4 2023. However, the user's instruction says to prefer \"Valid as Of\" if present. The record has \"Valid as Of: 2023-11-12\", so that's the date to use. The event name would be \"FEATURES FOR 2023 QRC 4 (VERSION 2023.24) — 2023-11-12\" with the description about the features.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. However, in these records, there's no mention of organizations, geos, or persons. The events are all about changes in SAP products, which are not entities in the allowed types (since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed here). Therefore, no relationships can be formed as there are no other entities involved. \n\nSo, all the extracted entities are events, and no relationships are present. Each event is based on the changes described in the records, using the \"Valid as Of\" date where available. The descriptions are truncated to 25 words as per the rules.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>LIMIT FOR MOVING FOLDERS — 2023-11-12<|>EVENT<|>Maximum folders movable at once increased to 300 in Manage Closing Task Lists)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PREDEFINED TASK FILTER CHANGED — 2023-11-12<|>EVENT<|>Tasks Completed with Errors filter now includes Failed status and renamed accordingly)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SEND NOTIFICATIONS TO ADDITIONAL INTERESTED USERS — 2023-11-12<|>EVENT<|>Notifications can now be sent to non-assigned users via Interested User/Group settings)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM BEHAVIOR CHANGED FOR SETTING TASK LISTS TO COMPLETED — 2023-11-12<|>EVENT<|>Warning replaces error message when tasks await approval during task list completion)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSLATION OF TASK LIST DEFAULT DESCRIPTIONS — 2023-11-12<|>EVENT<|>Task list descriptions now support translations for logon language display)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>USER INTERFACE CHANGES FOR UPLOADING ATTACHMENTS — 2023-11-12<|>EVENT<|>File type icons and messages updated in attachment upload interface)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURES FOR 2023 QRC 4 (VERSION 2023.24) — 2023-11-12<|>EVENT<|>SAP Analytics Cloud Q4 2023 release includes embedded help, forecast granularity, and chart enhancements)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923394, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1326, "prompt_tokens": 3917, "total_tokens": 5243, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.07702356185592, "duration": 41.338}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
