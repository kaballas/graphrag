The parameter is different from the existing parameters default-domain and region-primary-domain:      The parameter default-domain usually depends on the current organization setup and the existing shared domains for it. It is not reliable for regions without shared domains, for example regions China (Shanghai) and China (North 3). On the other hand, the region-domain parameter is more sustainable and does not depend on the current organization setup.  The parameters region-primary-domain and region-domain are equal when used in most of the regions. They are different when MTA deployments are done in target org/space in different CF APIs in one region.      Examples:  If the MTA deployment is done in a target org/space with CF API endpoint that is equal to api.eu10.hana.ondemand.com, the value of the domain would be:    default-domain: cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com      region-domain: eu10.hana.ondemand.com      region-primary-domain: eu10.hana.ondemand.com      If the MTA deployment is done in a target org/space with CF API endpoint that is equal to api.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com, the value of the domain would be:    default-domain: cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com      region-domain: eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com      region-primary-domain: eu10.hana.ondemand.com      See Parameters and Properties.\";\"Info only\";\"General Availability\";\"New\";\"Technology\";\"2025-09-18\";\"2025-09-18\";\"2509a\"\n\"SAP BTP Cockpit\";\"Cloud Foundry\";\"Events Page at Application Level: Improvements\";\"The updated Events page at the application level in the cockpit provides the following improvements:    Events page renamed to Application Events for improved clarity      Target column added to the page.
