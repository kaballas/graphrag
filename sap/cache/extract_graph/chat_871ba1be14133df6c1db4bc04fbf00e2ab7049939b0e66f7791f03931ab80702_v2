The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events, organizations, geos, and people. The entity types allowed are ORGANIZATION, PERSON, GEO, EVENT. \n\nStarting with Record 31: The title is \"Pre-Production - Configurations API – On-Request Tracing\". The description mentions a new trace setting ON_REQUEST. Since this is a new feature in Cloud Foundry, I should create an EVENT entity. The valid as of date is 2025-10-22. The event name would be \"ON-REQUEST TRACING FOR CONFIGURATIONS API — 2025-10-22\". The description should mention the new setting and the header parameter.\n\nRecord 32: Title is \"Pre-Production - Configurations API – Read Dependency Information\". New endpoint added. Another EVENT entity: \"READ DEPENDENCY INFORMATION API — 2025-10-22\". Description includes the new endpoint and existing endpoint extension.\n\nRecord 33: SAP Dynamic Forms Release 2509. The valid as of is 2025-10-21. EVENT name: \"SAP DYNAMIC FORMS RELEASE 2509 — 2025-10-21\". Description includes the features like object number addition, dropdown dataset support, user info in offline forms, and optional form version.\n\nRecord 34: Kyma Runtime upgrade to Kubernetes 1.33. The dates are in the schedule, but the valid as of is 2025-10-17. EVENT: \"KYMARUNTIME UPGRADE TO KUBERNETES 1.33 — 2025-10-17\". Description mentions the upgrade, schedule, and notes about deprecating v1 Endpoints API.\n\nRecord 35: Replacement of JWT library. Valid as of 2025-10-13. EVENT: \"JWT LIBRARY REPLACEMENT — 2025-10-13\". Description states the replacement for security and OIDC compliance.\n\nRecord 36: New fields for messages in Event Mesh. Valid as of 2025-10-06. EVENT: \"NEW MESSAGE FIELDS IN EVENT MESH — 2025-10-06\". Description includes delivery count, spool time, expiration.\n\nRecord 37: Reminder about Readiness Health Checks for MTA. The text is cut off, but the title mentions it. Assuming the valid as of is 2025-09-30 (since the reminder is for end of September 2025). EVENT: \"READINESS HEALTH CHECKS FOR MTA — 2025-09-30\". Description about the introduction of health checks.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. In Record 34, Kyma Runtime is mentioned, but the environment is Kyma. However, the rules say if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services/environments shouldn't be entities. But in the examples, like Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. Wait, the user's entity types include ORGANIZATION, so if the environment is a known service provider, like Kyma, but Kyma is part of SAP, maybe not an organization. Wait, the user's examples include SAP BTP, Microsoft Azure as organizations. So Kyma might be part of SAP, but the environment is Kyma. However, the rules say if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products/services. But in the examples, when a product is mentioned as an environment, like SAP BTP Neo, it's considered an organization. Hmm, this might be tricky. Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe rules state: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" Wait, the user's entity types include ORGANIZATION, so if the environment is a known organization, like Microsoft Azure, then it's allowed. But Kyma is an environment, but is it an organization? Maybe not. The user's examples include SAP BTP as an organization. So perhaps Kyma is part of SAP, but the environment is Kyma, which might not be an organization. So maybe no organizations here except for SAP BTP, but the records don't mention that. Wait, in Record 34, the environment is Kyma, but the component is Kyma Runtime. The user's examples have SAP BTP as an organization. However, in the given records, the environments are Cloud Foundry, Kyma, ABAP, etc. So perhaps none of these are organizations except for SAP BTP, but that's not mentioned here. So maybe no organizations to extract except for the ones explicitly named. Let me check the text again. \n\nLooking at the records, none of the components mention specific organizations like Microsoft Azure or SAP BTP. The environments are Cloud Foundry, Kyma, ABAP, etc. So perhaps no organizations to extract here. \n\nGEOs: The records mention regions like Middle East, Asia Pacific & Japan, Europe, Americas. These are real-world geographies. So for Record 34, the regions are BTP Live Middle East, APJ, Europe, Americas. These can be GEO entities. For example, \"MIDDLE EAST\" as a GEO, \"ASIA PACIFIC & JAPAN\" as GEO, \"EUROPE\" as GEO, \"AMERICAS\" as GEO. \n\nRelationships: For each event, if it's related to a GEO or ORGANIZATION. For example, the Kyma upgrade event (Record 34) occurs in the Middle East, APJ, Europe, Americas. So relationships between the event and each GEO. Also, the event might involve an organization, but if there's no explicit organization mentioned, maybe not. \n\nSo for Record 34's event, the relationships would be between the event and each GEO. The strength would be around 8-9. \n\nNow, compiling all the entities and relationships. Each event is an EVENT entity. The GEOs are the regions mentioned. No organizations found. \n\nLet me check each record again for possible organizations. Record 35 mentions Authorization and Trust Management Service, but that's a component, not an organization. Record 36: Event Mesh is a component. So no organizations. \n\nSo the final output would be the EVENT entities and the GEO relationships for Record 34.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ON-REQUEST TRACING FOR CONFIGURATIONS API — 2025-10-22<|>EVENT<|>New trace setting ON_REQUEST collects traces for subset of requests using x-cps-trace header with CONFIGURATION_ENGINE, EXTENSION, or DEPENDENCY_PROFILING types)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>READ DEPENDENCY INFORMATION API — 2025-10-22<|>EVENT<|>New endpoint GET /knowledgebases/{kbId}/dependencies/{dependencyId} returns dependency data; existing endpoint extended to list dependencies)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP DYNAMIC FORMS RELEASE 2509 — 2025-10-21<|>EVENT<|>Object number added to MAIF linkage table; dropdown dataset populated from S/4 data; user info passed into offline forms; Form Version field optional)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KYMARUNTIME UPGRADE TO KUBERNETES 1.33 — 2025-10-17<|>EVENT<|>Kyma environment upgrade to Kubernetes 1.33 with scheduled regional outages; v1 Endpoints API deprecated in favor of EndpointSlice API)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JWT LIBRARY REPLACEMENT — 2025-10-13<|>EVENT<|>JSON Web Token library replaced for improved security and OIDC compliance with no customer impact)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW MESSAGE FIELDS IN EVENT MESH — 2025-10-06<|>EVENT<|>Message delivery count, spool time, and expiration now visible in Event Mesh monitoring)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>READINESS HEALTH CHECKS FOR MTA — 2025-09-30<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Foundry MTA deployment requires readiness health checks starting late September 2025)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MIDDLE EAST<|>GEO<|>Region for BTP Live Kubernetes 1.33 upgrade on 2025-10-17 17:00-21:00 UTC)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ASIA PACIFIC & JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Region for BTP Live Kubernetes 1.33 upgrade on 2025-10-18 14:00-17:00 UTC)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Region for BTP Live Kubernetes 1.33 upgrade on 2025-10-18 21:00-24:00 UTC)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAS<|>GEO<|>Region for BTP Live Kubernetes 1.33 upgrade on 2025-10-19 06:00-09:00 UTC)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>KYMARUNTIME UPGRADE TO KUBERNETES 1.33 — 2025-10-17<|>MIDDLE EAST<|>Event occurs in this geographic region<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>KYMARUNTIME UPGRADE TO KUBERNETES 1.33 — 2025-10-17<|>ASIA PACIFIC & JAPAN<|>Event occurs in this geographic region<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>KYMARUNTIME UPGRADE TO KUBERNETES 1.33 — 2025-10-17<|>EUROPE<|>Event occurs in this geographic region<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>KYMARUNTIME UPGRADE TO KUBERNETES 1.33 — 2025-10-17<|>AMERICAS<|>Event occurs in this geographic region<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925398, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2341, "prompt_tokens": 3943, "total_tokens": 6284, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.67194306897205, "duration": 73.914}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Note: As part of the migration, new workers are created, and the existing worker nodes are drained (application Pods evicted) and removed. To minimize disruption to your workloads, it is advisable to ensure the availability of your applications by running multiple replicas across different Availability Zones and configuring Pod Disruption Budgets.  Note: The v1 Endpoints API is now officially deprecated (though still fully supported).
