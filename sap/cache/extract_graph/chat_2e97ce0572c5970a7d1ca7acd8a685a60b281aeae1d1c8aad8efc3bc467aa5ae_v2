The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify for an EVENT entity. \n\nStarting with Record 1441: \"Cloud Identity Services have been upgraded.\" This is a regular upgrade, so it's an EVENT. The name would be \"CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES UPGRADE — 2025-02-11\" with a description about the upgrade.\n\nRecord 1442 mentions new regions in AWS and Azure. The title is \"New Regions,\" so the EVENT name would be \"NEW REGIONS SUPPORT — 2025-02-11.\" The description includes the regions added. Then, the organizations involved are AMAZON WEB SERVICES and MICROSOFT AZURE, and the GEOs are CANADA (MONTREAL), AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY), JAPAN (TOKYO), and SINGAPORE. Relationships would link the EVENT to each organization and GEO.\n\nRecord 1443 talks about group mapping changes. This is a \"Changed\" type, so it's an EVENT. The name would be \"GROUP MAPPING CHANGES — 2025-02-11\" with the description about supporting application-specific groups.\n\nRecord 1444 introduces a new conditional function. That's a \"New\" type, so EVENT: \"NEW CONDITIONAL FUNCTION IMPLEMENTED — 2025-02-11\" with the description about the isRegularGroup function.\n\nRecord 1445 is about provisioning sub-attributes of emails. Another \"Changed\" type, so EVENT: \"PROVISIONING SUB-ATTRIBUTES OF EMAILS — 2025-02-11\" with the description about reading SCIM sub-attributes.\n\nRecord 1446 mentions improvements in error messaging for SAP Task Center. EVENT: \"SAP TASK CENTER ERROR MESSAGING IMPROVEMENTS — 2025-02-11\" with the description.\n\nRecord 1447 is a documentation update, which might not be an EVENT since it's just a change in documentation. The rules say to represent changes as EVENT if they're releases, upgrades, etc., but a documentation update might not qualify. So maybe skip this one.\n\nRecord 1448 adds support for document formats in Joule. EVENT: \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF — 2025-02-10\" with the description.\n\nRecord 1449 is an API Gateway update. EVENT: \"API GATEWAY MODULE UPDATE TO VERSION 2.10.4 — 2025-02-10\" with the fix description.\n\nRecord 1450 introduces a new add-on for SAP Build Process Automation. EVENT: \"SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION FOUNDATION ADD-ON BY UIPATH — 2025\" with the description about configuring UiPath automations.\n\nNow, checking for entities. Organizations like AMAZON WEB SERVICES, MICROSOFT AZURE, SAP TASK CENTER, etc. GEOs like CANADA (MONTREAL), AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY), etc. Events as per each record. Relationships would link the events to the organizations and GEOs where applicable. For example, the NEW REGIONS SUPPORT event is related to the organizations and their respective GEOs.\n\nNeed to ensure all entity types are correct, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are valid. Also, check that no products/services are emitted as entities unless they're part of an EVENT. For example, \"SAP TASK CENTER\" is part of the event description but not an entity unless it's an organization, which it's not. So, only the organizations and GEOs mentioned explicitly are entities.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES UPGRADE — 2025-02-11<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services upgraded across Cloud Foundry, Kyma, and Neo environments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW REGIONS SUPPORT — 2025-02-11<|>EVENT<|>SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery now supports AWS Canada (Montreal) and Azure Australia (Sydney), Japan (Tokyo), Singapore)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GROUP MAPPING CHANGES — 2025-02-11<|>EVENT<|>Identity Provisioning updates to support application-specific group provisioning for SAP Ariba, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Microsoft Entra ID, and SAP ABAP)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CONDITIONAL FUNCTION IMPLEMENTED — 2025-02-11<|>EVENT<|>isRegularGroup function added to verify if a group is a regular user group in Identity Provisioning)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PROVISIONING SUB-ATTRIBUTES OF EMAILS — 2025-02-11<|>EVENT<|>Identity Provisioning now reads all SCIM-defined sub-attributes (value, type, primary, display) of the emails attribute)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP TASK CENTER ERROR MESSAGING IMPROVEMENTS — 2025-02-11<|>EVENT<|>Enhanced error messaging in SAP Task Center Web and Administration apps)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF — 2025-02-10<|>EVENT<|>Joule document grounding now supports JPEG, JPG, PNG, and TIFF file formats)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>API GATEWAY MODULE UPDATE TO VERSION 2.10.4 — 2025-02-10<|>EVENT<|>Fixed issue #1632: v2alpha1 APIRule workloads now accessible within clusters in Kyma Runtime)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION FOUNDATION ADD-ON BY UIPATH — 2025<|>EVENT<|>UiPath Studio Web integration allows configuring/test automations directly in SAP Build Process Automation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON WEB SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery in Canada (Montreal))  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery in Australia (Sydney), Japan (Tokyo), and Singapore)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CANADA (MONTREAL)<|>GEO<|>AWS region where SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)<|>GEO<|>Azure region where SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN (TOKYO)<|>GEO<|>Azure region where SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SINGAPORE<|>GEO<|>Azure region where SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery is now available)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS SUPPORT — 2025-02-11<|>AMAZON WEB SERVICES<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS SUPPORT — 2025-02-11<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS SUPPORT — 2025-02-11<|>CANADA (MONTREAL)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS SUPPORT — 2025-02-11<|>AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS SUPPORT — 2025-02-11<|>JAPAN (TOKYO)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS SUPPORT — 2025-02-11<|>SINGAPORE<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925512, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1865, "prompt_tokens": 3948, "total_tokens": 5813, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.0424713078139, "duration": 58.204}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
