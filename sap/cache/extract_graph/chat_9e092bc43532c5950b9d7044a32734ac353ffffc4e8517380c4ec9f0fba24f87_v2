The user provided some real data from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. There are two records here. Let's look at each one.\n\nStarting with the first record: \"Edge Integration Cell from scratch, in the event of a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster environment loss. See: Perform Emergency Recovery\". The key points here are the Edge Integration Cell, Kubernetes (K8s) cluster environment loss, and the action to perform emergency recovery. \n\nAccording to the steps, I need to create EVENT entities for releases, upgrades, etc. The phrase \"in the event of a Kubernetes cluster environment loss\" suggests an event related to emergency recovery. The valid as of date is 2024-09-21. So the event name would be something like \"EMERGENCY RECOVERY FOR EDGE INTEGRATION CELL — 2024-09-21\". The description should mention the scenario and the action. \n\nNext, check if there are any organizations, people, or geos. Kubernetes is a technology, not an organization, so it's not an entity here. The Edge Integration Cell is a product, but since the entity types don't include technology, it's not an entity. So the only entity here is the EVENT.\n\nNow the second record: \"New Thread Dump and Heap Dump Diagnostic Tasks\". The description says you can create thread dumps and heap dumps in Diagnostics. This is a new feature, so another EVENT. The name would be \"THREAD DUMP AND HEAP DUMP DIAGNOSTIC TASKS — 2024-09-21\". The description should mention the new diagnostic tasks.\n\nAgain, checking for other entities. The Environment is Cloud Foundry, but since the entity types don't include technology, we don't emit that. So only the EVENT entities here.\n\nNow, relationships. The first event might involve Kubernetes, but since Kubernetes isn't an entity (it's a technology), we can't create a relationship. The second event doesn't mention any other entities either. So no relationships to emit.\n\nWait, the first record mentions \"Edge Integration Cell\" and \"Kubernetes cluster environment loss\". But Edge Integration Cell is a product, which isn't an entity type here. So no entities beyond the events. \n\nSo the output should have two EVENT entities and no relationships. Let me structure them properly with uppercase names and descriptions under 25 words. Check the dates and ensure they're in ISO format. Also, make sure the entity types are correct. No other entities to include. Relationships are not applicable here. \n\nDouble-checking the rules: no products/services as entities since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed. Only events. Looks good. Now format the output as per the examples.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>EMERGENCY RECOVERY FOR EDGE INTEGRATION CELL — 2024-09-21<|>EVENT<|>Recover Edge Integration Cell from scratch in case of Kubernetes cluster environment loss)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>THREAD DUMP AND HEAP DUMP DIAGNOSTIC TASKS — 2024-09-21<|>EVENT<|>New diagnostic tasks for creating thread dumps and heap dumps in Diagnostics)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923223, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 711, "prompt_tokens": 2843, "total_tokens": 3554, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.86340414089809, "duration": 22.314}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
