The user provided some SAP \"What's New\" entries and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the text for each record. Let's start with the first record about the Tomcat version update. The key points are the update to Tomcat 9.0.98, the runtime versions, and the recommended action. Since the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and the text mentions a version change, which is a \"Changed\" type under Technology. According to the steps, when TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed entity types, changes should be represented as EVENT entities. So, the event here would be the Tomcat version update. The entity name should be something like \"TOMCAT VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-23\" with the description mentioning the update and the recommended action.\n\nNext, the second record about the delay between operations for token signing keys. The description mentions increasing the delay from 1 hour to 12 hours. This is a change in the service's behavior, so another EVENT entity. The name could be \"DELAY BETWEEN OPERATIONS FOR TOKEN SIGNING KEYS INCREASED — 2025-01-23\". The description would note the increase in delay and the reason.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The first event (Tomcat update) doesn't mention any organizations, geos, or other events, so no relationships. The second event is related to the \"Authorization and Trust Management Service\" component. However, the entity types allowed don't include components or services unless they're organizations. Since \"Authorization and Trust Management Service\" isn't an organization, person, geo, or event, it's not an entity. Therefore, no relationships to emit here.\n\nI need to ensure all entities are in uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are only if there's a clear dependency. Since neither of the events mention any other entities, there are no relationships to add. \n\nDouble-checking the rules: no products/services as entities when TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, which applies here. Both events are correctly formatted as EVENT entities with the specified date. Descriptions are concise and factual. No invalid entities or relationships. Looks good.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMCAT VERSION UPDATE — 2025-01-23<|>EVENT<|>Java Web Tomcat 9 and Java EE 7 Web Profile TomEE 7 updated to Tomcat 9.0.98; applications should use latest runtime versions)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DELAY BETWEEN OPERATIONS FOR TOKEN SIGNING KEYS INCREASED — 2025-01-23<|>EVENT<|>Minimum delay between signing key operations increased from 1-hour to 12-hours to ensure replication across landscape)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926615, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 616, "prompt_tokens": 2990, "total_tokens": 3606, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.630295250320923, "duration": 19.475}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
