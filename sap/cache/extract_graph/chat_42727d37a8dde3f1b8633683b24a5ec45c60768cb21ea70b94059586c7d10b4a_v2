The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP release notes based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to go through each record and identify the events, organizations, geos, and people mentioned.\n\nStarting with Record 31: It's about new navigational use cases in Joule for SAP BTP Cockpit. The event name should be \"NEW NAVIGATIONAL USE CASES ADDED TO JOULE IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-07-22\". The description mentions Service Marketplace, Routes, Security Groups, but those are part of the event, not separate entities. Since the component is Joule and SAP BTP Cockpit, but the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. SAP BTP Cockpit might be an organization? Wait, the rules say if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, but here the entity types include organization. Wait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. So SAP BTP Cockpit is a product, but under the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, we don't emit products. However, in the examples, like Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So SAP BTP Cockpit might be considered an organization? Or maybe not. Wait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" But in this case, the entity types include organization, so maybe SAP BTP Cockpit is an organization? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's part of the event description. Let me check the examples again. In Example D, the event is about Joule being available in Microsoft Azure's data center. Microsoft Azure is an organization. So in this case, SAP BTP Cockpit might be a product, but since the user's entity types include organization, perhaps it's considered an organization? Or maybe not. Hmm. Maybe I should treat SAP BTP Cockpit as part of the event description rather than an entity. Let me proceed.\n\nNext, Record 32: Enhancements to Joule. The event name would be \"JOULE ENHANCEMENTS — 2025-07-15\". The description mentions co-referencing complex message types and error handling. No organizations or geos here, so just the event.\n\nRecord 33: Document Grounding supports JSON and PPTX. The providers are Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure. These are organizations. The regions mentioned are Europe (Frankfurt), US East (VA), etc. Those are geos. So for each provider, create an organization entity. For the regions, create geo entities. The event here is \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JSON AND PPTX — 2025-07-11\". The description links the event to the providers and regions.\n\nRecord 34: Integration with SAP Build Work Zone. SAP Build Work Zone is an organization. The event is \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING INTEGRATION WITH SAP BUILD WORK ZONE — 2025-07-11\".\n\nRecord 35: Joule navigation in SAP Integrated Business Planning. The event is \"JOULE NAVIGATION IN SAP INTEGRATED BUSINESS PLANNING — 2025-07-04\".\n\nRecord 36: Administrative use cases added in SAP BTP Cockpit. The event is \"NEW ADMINISTRATIVE USE CASES IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-07-04\". The component includes SAP BTP Cockpit again, but again, whether that's an organization is unclear. Maybe not, so just the event.\n\nRecord 37: Project assistant capabilities. The event is \"PROJECT ASSISTANT CAPABILITIES FOR JOULE — 2025-06-26\".\n\nRecord 38: Analytical Insights integration with SAP Analytics Cloud. SAP Analytics Cloud is an organization. The event is \"ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS INTEGRATION WITH SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD — 2025-06-24\".\n\nNow, for relationships. For example, in Record 33, the event is linked to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure. So relationships between the event and each organization. Similarly, the regions (geos) are linked to the event. In Record 34, the event is linked to SAP Build Work Zone. In Record 38, the event is linked to SAP Analytics Cloud.\n\nI need to make sure all entities are in uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formed with strength between 1-10. Also, check that no products are emitted as entities unless they are organizations. For example, SAP BTP Cockpit might be a product, but if it's not an organization, it's not emitted. However, in the examples, SAP BTP Cockpit wasn't mentioned as an entity, so maybe it's not. So the events are the main entities here, and the organizations and geos are linked to them.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW NAVIGATIONAL USE CASES ADDED TO JOULE IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-07-22<|>EVENT<|>Joule in SAP BTP Cockpit now navigates to Service Marketplace, Routes, and Security Groups in Cloud Foundry spaces)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE ENHANCEMENTS — 2025-07-15<|>EVENT<|>Co-referencing complex message types and transparent error handling for LLM errors in Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JSON AND PPTX — 2025-07-11<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports JSON and PPTX documents in document grounding for AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON WEB SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud service provider supporting document grounding in JSON/PPTX formats)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud service provider supporting document grounding in JSON/PPTX formats)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud service provider supporting document grounding in JSON/PPTX formats)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE (FRANKFURT)<|>GEO<|>Region supporting JSON/PPTX document grounding in AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>US EAST (VA)<|>GEO<|>Region supporting JSON/PPTX document grounding in AWS and Microsoft Azure)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EU NETHERLANDS<|>GEO<|>Region supporting JSON/PPTX document grounding in Microsoft Azure)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING INTEGRATION WITH SAP BUILD WORK ZONE — 2025-07-11<|>EVENT<|>Joule integrates document grounding with SAP Build Work Zone advanced edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BUILD WORK ZONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platform for document grounding integration with Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE NAVIGATION IN SAP INTEGRATED BUSINESS PLANNING — 2025-07-04<|>EVENT<|>Joule enables navigation to apps in SAP Integrated Business Planning)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW ADMINISTRATIVE USE CASES IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-07-04<|>EVENT<|>Joule adds user management, trust configuration, and service instance navigation in SAP BTP Cockpit)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PROJECT ASSISTANT CAPABILITIES FOR JOULE — 2025-06-26<|>EVENT<|>Joule supports WBS element display and project change summarization in SAP S/4HANA Cloud)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS INTEGRATION WITH SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD — 2025-06-24<|>EVENT<|>Joule requires SAP Analytics Cloud integration for analytical insights access)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platform for analytical insights integration with Joule)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JSON AND PPTX — 2025-07-11<|>AMAZON WEB SERVICES<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JSON AND PPTX — 2025-07-11<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JSON AND PPTX — 2025-07-11<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JSON AND PPTX — 2025-07-11<|>EUROPE (FRANKFURT)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JSON AND PPTX — 2025-07-11<|>US EAST (VA)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR JSON AND PPTX — 2025-07-11<|>EU NETHERLANDS<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING INTEGRATION WITH SAP BUILD WORK ZONE — 2025-07-11<|>SAP BUILD WORK ZONE<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS INTEGRATION WITH SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD — 2025-06-24<|>SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921572, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2295, "prompt_tokens": 3553, "total_tokens": 5848, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 35.99153140437544, "duration": 63.765}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
