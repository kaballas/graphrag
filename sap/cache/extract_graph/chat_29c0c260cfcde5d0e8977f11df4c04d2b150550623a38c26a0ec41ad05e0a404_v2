The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" release notes based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify the components, environments, titles, descriptions, and dates. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. \n\nStarting with Record 2981: The component is UI Theme Designer in Cloud Foundry. The title is \"Migrating Themes\" and the description mentions migrating themes based on different SAP standard themes. The valid as of date is 2024-05-08. Since this is a new feature, I should create an EVENT entity. The name would be \"MIGRATING THEMES — 2024-05-08\" with a description about the ability to migrate themes.\n\nNext, Record 2982: Kyma Runtime in Kyma environment. The title is \"Telemetry module: Update to version 1.14.0\". This is a change, so an EVENT. The description mentions improvements in resource setup, logs, traces, metrics. The valid as of is 2024-05-07. The event name would be \"TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE TO 1.14.0 — 2024-05-07\" with a description about the improvements.\n\nRecord 2983: SAP Datasphere in Cloud Foundry. Title is \"Features for Version 2024.10\". New features in administration, data integration, etc. Valid as of 2024-05-07. EVENT entity: \"SAP DATASPHHERE 2024.10 FEATURES — 2024-05-07\" with the description.\n\nRecord 2984: SAP S/4HANA Cloud for Credit Integration. New credit agency Cerved Group S.p.A. Valid as of 2024-05-07. Here, Cerved Group S.p.A. is an organization. So, an EVENT for the integration and an ORGANIZATION entity for Cerved. The relationship would be the event involving the organization.\n\nRecord 2985: Service Ticket Intelligence in Cloud Foundry. Consuming via AI API (Beta). Changed type, valid as of 2024-05-06. EVENT entity: \"SERVICE TICKET INTELLIGENCE AI API CONSUMPTION — 2024-05-06\" with the description about operations no longer available.\n\nRecord 2986: Pricing Service in Cloud Foundry. Extension concept with cache eviction fix. Valid as of 2024-05-06. EVENT entity: \"PRICING SERVICE EXTENSION CACHE EVICTION FIX — 2024-05-06\" with the description.\n\nRecord 2987: Integration Suite General Features. Built-in support added. Valid as of 2024-05-05. EVENT entity: \"INTEGRATION SUITE BUILT-IN SUPPORT — 2024-05-05\" with the description about finding solutions and filing incidents.\n\nRecord 2988: Cloud Application Programming Model. April release with highlights. Valid as of 2024-05-03. EVENT entity: \"CLOUD APPLICATION PROGRAMMING MODEL APRIL RELEASE — 2024-05-03\" with the description of features.\n\nRecord 2989: SAP S/4HANA Cloud for Credit. The text is incomplete, so I'll skip it.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. In Record 2984, Cerved Group S.p.A. is an organization. Need to make sure it's capitalized and the description is correct.\n\nRelationships: For each event, check if it's related to an organization or geo. For example, the integration with Cerved would have a relationship between the event and the organization. Other events might not have relationships if they don't mention specific orgs or locations.\n\nI need to ensure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formed with strength between 1-10. Also, no invalid entities or relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>MIGRATING THEMES — 2024-05-08<|>EVENT<|>Migrate custom themes based on different SAP standard themes via welcome screen<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE TO 1.14.0 — 2024-05-07<|>EVENT<|>Improved resource setup, certificate validation, and status messages in telemetry pipelines<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP DATASPHHERE 2024.10 FEATURES — 2024-05-07<|>EVENT<|>New features for administration, data integration, marketplace, and modeling in SAP Datasphere<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CERVED GROUP S.P.A.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Credit agency integrated with SAP S/4HANA Cloud for credit integration<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE TICKET INTELLIGENCE AI API CONSUMPTION — 2024-05-06<|>EVENT<|>Deprecated API operations for execution creation and model deployment in AI service<|>6)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRICING SERVICE EXTENSION CACHE EVICTION FIX — 2024-05-06<|>EVENT<|>Resolved cache eviction failures for extension-based pricing service calls<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATION SUITE BUILT-IN SUPPORT — 2024-05-05<|>EVENT<|>Search knowledge base articles and file incidents directly from SAP Integration Suite<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD APPLICATION PROGRAMMING MODEL APRIL RELEASE — 2024-05-03<|>EVENT<|>New features: fewer database views, expression annotations, CDS shell completion<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP S/4HANA CREDIT INTEGRATION WITH CERVED — 2024-05-07<|>CERVED GROUP S.P.A.<|>Event involves integration with this credit agency<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926450, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1415, "prompt_tokens": 3949, "total_tokens": 5364, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.16859526678336, "duration": 43.987}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
