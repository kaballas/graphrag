The user provided a detailed text about various SAP updates and wants entities and relationships extracted based on specific rules. First, I need to parse the text and identify events, organizations, people, and geos.\n\nLooking at the text, the main components are updates to SAP Analytics Cloud, Process Visibility Capability, and SAP Build Process Automation. The first part talks about enhancements in SAP Analytics Cloud, like new chart types and performance improvements. Since these are new features, they should be events. The event name would be something like \"SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD ENHANCEMENTS — 2023-11-11\" with a description mentioning the improvements.\n\nNext, there are two records (3868 and 3869) about execution limits in Process Visibility Capability. These are changes, so they should be events too. The event names would be \"PROCESS VISIBILITY EXECUTION LIMITS — 2023-11-10\" and similar. The description would note the updated limits and the need to adjust implementations.\n\nThe third record (3870) is about ABAP Development Tools, which is a new feature. That's another event: \"ABAP DEVELOPMENT TOOLS ENHANCEMENT — 2023-11-10\".\n\nNow, checking for organizations. The text mentions SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Note 3341306, and ABAP Environment. However, according to the rules, only explicitly mentioned organizations like SAP BTP, Microsoft Azure, etc., should be included. SAP is a company, so \"SAP\" as an organization might be valid. But the user's examples didn't include SAP as an organization, so maybe it's better to avoid unless explicitly stated. The note references SAP Note, which is an internal document, so maybe not an organization.\n\nGeos aren't mentioned here, so no GEO entities. No named individuals, so no PERSON entities. The rest are events. \n\nRelationships: The events might relate to SAP as the organization, but since the user's examples didn't include that, and the rules say to avoid products/services as entities unless allowed. Since the entity types here are organization, person, geo, event, and the technology is part of the event descriptions, not as separate entities, I think the events are standalone. So no relationships needed.\n\nFinal check: Ensure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and events are correctly named with dates. No invalid entities. Looks good.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD ENHANCEMENTS — 2023-11-11<|>EVENT<|>New chart types (stacked column/bar), horizontal table scrolling, drag-and-drop objects, and performance improvements for large currency tables in SAP Analytics Cloud)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS VISIBILITY EXECUTION LIMITS — 2023-11-10<|>EVENT<|>Updated event acquisition limits and payload size for Process Visibility Capability; see SAP Note 3341306 for implementation adjustments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION EXECUTION LIMITS — 2023-11-10<|>EVENT<|>Updated event acquisition limits and payload size for Process Visibility in SAP Build Process Automation; see SAP Note 3341306 for implementation adjustments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ABAP DEVELOPMENT TOOLS ENHANCEMENT — 2023-11-10<|>EVENT<|>Display component groups in Variables view for ABAP Development Tools in Eclipse)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923408, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 782, "prompt_tokens": 3572, "total_tokens": 4354, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.592130246838767, "duration": 24.753}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.

ToPeriod can also be used in combination with LOOKUP or RESTRICT.  You can now combine formulas with other formulas in calculated measures. This improvement will save you time, as you’ll no longer have to create multiple calculated measure to combine LOOKUP, RESTRICT, YOY, SMA & CAGR with other formulas.  Performance improvements are possible for currency rates tables containing large volumes of data. This follows the introduction of the Data Import API for currency data in QRC3. These include improved loading times, saving times, and improved filtering handling for large currency rates tables.  As a preview for what’s coming next in the Modeling and upcoming enhancements, check out this blog.    Data Analyzer improvements:  You can now find the following improvements for the chart usage in data analyzer:  You can now also use the Stacked Column and the Stacked Bar charts for the visualization of your data.  You can now use the chart visualization with all model types except the classic account model.  There are user experience improvements in the builder panel for charts.    In the table visualization in data analyzer you can now scroll horizontally if the table has a large number of columns. If there are more than 100 columns a warning message is displayed to use the filter function and restrict the number of columns.  In data analyzer you can now drag objects from the builder panel on the table. The following object types are supported:  Dimensions  Display attributes (connected with the associated dimension)  Measure/Account structures      For a complete list of the new features brought to SAP Analytics Cloud as part of the Q4 2023 launch, check out the brand new What’s New Viewer.
