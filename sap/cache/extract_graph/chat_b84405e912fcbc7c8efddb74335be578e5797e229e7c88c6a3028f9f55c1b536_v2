The user provided a text about updating SAP HANA and mentions end-of-maintenance for SAP HANA 1.0. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event.\n\nFirst, I need to extract entities. The main event here is the update to SAP HANA revision 2.00.078.00. That's an EVENT. The note about SAP HANA 1.0 reaching end of mainstream maintenance is another EVENT. \n\nFor the first event: \"SAP HANA 2 SPS07 REVISION 078.00 — 2024-06-14\" as the name. Description would be updating to this revision. \n\nSecond event: \"SAP HANA 1.0 END-OF-MAINTENANCE — 2021-06-01\" since the end was in June 2021. Description mentions end of mainstream maintenance and upgrading to SAP HANA 2.0.\n\nNow, relationships. The first event (SAP HANA 2 update) is related to SAP HANA 2.0 as the product, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity, I can't include that. Wait, the user said if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, represent changes as EVENT. So maybe the SAP HANA 2.0 is part of the event description but not an entity. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" So SAP HANA 2.0 is a product, which is a TECHNOLOGY, but since we can't emit it as an entity, we just include it in the event description. \n\nSo the entities are the two events. No organizations or geos mentioned here. The note mentions SAP BTP, Neo Environment, but that's part of the description, not an entity. \n\nSo the output should have two events. No relationships because there's no clear dependency between the events and other entities. \n\nCheck the output against the examples. Example B had an event with a description. So the two events here are valid. No other entities to extract. Relationships aren't applicable here. So the final output is the two events.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP HANA 2 SPS07 REVISION 078.00 — 2024-06-14<|>EVENT<|>Update to SAP HANA revision 2.00.078.00 available per note 3447850)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP HANA 1.0 END-OF-MAINTENANCE — 2021-06-01<|>EVENT<|>SAP HANA 1.0 reached end of mainstream maintenance; upgrade to SAP HANA 2.0 recommended)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925706, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 641, "prompt_tokens": 2836, "total_tokens": 3477, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 29.94487526861628, "duration": 21.406}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
