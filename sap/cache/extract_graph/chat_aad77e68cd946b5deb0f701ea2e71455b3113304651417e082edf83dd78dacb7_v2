The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the first text block. It mentions \"SAP Cloud Identity Services infrastructure\" and \"Generate and Manage Certificates for Outbound Connection.\" The key here is that the certificate renewal is a change, so that's an EVENT. The organization would be SAP CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES. The description should mention the certificate validity and renewal, and the infrastructure.\n\nNext, the second record is about the release of the Istio module in Kyma Runtime. The title is \"Release of the Istio module,\" which is an EVENT. The date is December 6, 2023. The description mentions Istio as a service mesh, so that's part of the event description. The organization here is KYMA, and the event involves the release of the Istio module. Also, the Kyma Runtime is part of the environment, but since the entity types don't include technology, I need to check if Kyma is an organization. The text says \"Kyma Runtime\" under the component, but the environment is Kyma. Maybe Kyma is an organization here. The relationship would be the event involving the organization.\n\nThird record is about SAP Document AI's new service plan, Premium Edition. This is a new service plan, so an EVENT. The organization is SAP DOCUMENT AI. The description includes the availability of the premium edition and using generative AI. The relationship would be the event involving the organization.\n\nI need to make sure all entities are in uppercase and fit the types. Check for any GEOs or PERSONs, but the text doesn't mention any. So, the main entities are the events and the organizations involved. Relationships would link the events to the organizations. Also, ensure the event names follow the pattern: short title with date. For the first event, the title might be \"CERTIFICATE RENEWAL REQUIREMENT — 2023-12-06\" and the description about managing certificates. \n\nFor the Istio module, the event name is \"ISTIO MODULE RELEASE — 2023-12-06\" with the description about the release and its features. The organization is KYMA, and the relationship is the event involving the organization. \n\nFor the SAP Document AI, the event is \"PREMIUM EDITION SERVICE PLAN — 2023-12-06\" with the description about the new service plan. The organization is SAP DOCUMENT AI, and the relationship is the event involving the organization.\n\nI need to check if all entities are correctly categorized and relationships are valid. No GEOs or PERSONs here, so only events and organizations. Also, ensure the descriptions are under 25 words and relationships under 20 words with strength between 1-10.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFICATE RENEWAL REQUIREMENT — 2023-12-06<|>EVENT<|>Manual certificate renewal required for tenants on SAP Cloud Identity Services infrastructure)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Infrastructure provider for tenants requiring manual certificate renewal)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CERTIFICATE RENEWAL REQUIREMENT — 2023-12-06<|>SAP CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>Event applies to infrastructure provided by this organization<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ISTIO MODULE RELEASE — 2023-12-06<|>EVENT<|>Istio service mesh module released for Kyma Runtime with default activation in clusters)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>KYMA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing runtime environment for Istio module deployment)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ISTIO MODULE RELEASE — 2023-12-06<|>KYMA<|>Event involves organization's runtime environment<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PREMIUM EDITION SERVICE PLAN — 2023-12-06<|>EVENT<|>SAP Document AI introduces generative AI-powered premium service plan for document processing)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI-powered document processing service offering premium edition with LLM capabilities)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PREMIUM EDITION SERVICE PLAN — 2023-12-06<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI<|>Event introduces new service plan from this organization<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923138, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1007, "prompt_tokens": 3183, "total_tokens": 4190, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.877338470077376, "duration": 30.629}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
