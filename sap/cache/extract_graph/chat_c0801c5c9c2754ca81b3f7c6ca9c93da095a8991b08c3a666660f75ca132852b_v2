The user provided a text document with various entries related to technology updates and changes in different systems, along with entity types: organization, person, geo, and event. My task is to identify all entities of these types and their relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the text to find entities. The text seems to be a list of entries with fields like \"Identity Provisioning\", \"Neo\", \"System reset confirmation message extended\", etc. Each entry has a title, possibly an organization, and details about changes or updates. \n\nLooking for organizations: \"Neo\", \"Kyma\", \"SAP Task Center\", \"Cloud Foundry\", \"UI Theme Designer\", \"Content Agent Service\", \"SAP Build Process Automation\", \"SAP Document AI\", \"SAP Dynamic Forms\", \"SAP Cloud Transport Management\", \"SAP API Management\", \"XSUAA\", \"SAP Business Technology Platform\", \"SAP Field Service Management\". These all seem like organization names or product names under SAP or other tech companies.\n\nFor persons: The text doesn't mention any specific individuals, so maybe there are no person entities here.\n\nGeos: The text mentions \"Cloud\" multiple times, but that's a service type, not a geographic location. There's no mention of countries, cities, or regions, so maybe no geo entities.\n\nEvents: The entries have dates and descriptions of changes, like \"Release 3.1.0 of the API Gateway module\", \"SAP Field Service Management Supported as Task Provider\", \"Theme Transport using SAP Content Agent Service\", etc. These could be events, but the user might consider them as part of the organization's activities rather than separate events. However, the entity type includes \"event\", so I need to check if any specific events are named. The dates might indicate events, but the text doesn't explicitly name events like conferences or launches. Maybe the updates themselves are considered events, but the examples given in the problem didn't include such cases. Alternatively, the \"General Availability\" and \"New\" statuses might be part of the event description, but not the event name itself. So perhaps there are no explicit event entities here.\n\nNow, relationships: Organizations are related through their interactions. For example, \"SAP Task Center\" and \"SAP Field Service Management\" are connected because the latter is now a task provider for the former. \"UI Theme Designer\" is related to \"Cloud Foundry\" (but wait, in the text, the geo is \"Firuzabad\" and \"Tiruzia\" is the capital of Firuzabad. So, \"Tiruzia\" is the capital of Firuzabad, and \"Krohaara\" is the capital of Quintara. So, \"Cashion\" is the capital of Aurelia. So, \"Cashion\" is a geo entity. \n\nWait, the user's text is about a hostage exchange between Firuzabad and Aurelia, with Quintara as the broker. The entities include countries, people, and locations. The relationships are based on the events described. So, in the example, the entities are organizations, persons, and geos. The relationships are based on the events described. \n\nIn the real data, the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The text is a list of entities and relationships. The output should be in the format specified. \n\nWait, the user's real data is the text provided. Let me check the real data. The entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The text is:\n\n\"TechGlobal's (TG) stock skyrocketed in its opening day on the Global Exchange Thursday.

Separation of Form Builder, Form Runner, and Form Administrator Roles: Previously, you could only set up Roles and Role Collections by granting users access to the Form Builder, Form Administrator, and Form Runner features simultaneously. Going forward, by creating separate Roles, you can assign access to Form Builder, Form Runner, and Form Administrator individually. For more information, see:    Setting Up Roles and Role Collections for SAP Dynamic Forms Users      End-User Roles and Role Collections          Sending Emails with SAP Dynamic Forms Information: You can send emails to individuals and general inboxes to alert your employees about Dynamic Forms.
