See Restart of Workloads with Enabled Istio Sidecar Injection, Istio sidecar documentation, and Kubernetes Native Sidecars in Istio.    We've updated the Istio version to 1.26.2. For more information, read the Istio 1.26.2 release announcement and Istio 1.26.0 release announcement.  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.  We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled.  We've fixed a bug where the app.kubernetes.io/version label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources.  \";\"Info only\";\"General Availability\";\"Changed\";\"Technology\";\"2025-07-22\";\"2025-08-11\";\"Cloud\"\n\"SAP Document AI\";\"Cloud Foundry\";\"Integration of SAP Document AI (Embedded Edition) with SAP Mobile Start\";\"You can now integrate SAP Document AI with SAP Mobile Start.
