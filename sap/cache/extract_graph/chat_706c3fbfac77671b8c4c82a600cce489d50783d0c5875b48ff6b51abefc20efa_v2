The user provided some text from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the text for any mentions of organizations, people, geographical locations, or events. The text here is about Trading Partner Management in Cloud Foundry, with two records (4019 and 4020). The main components are \"Custom Search Attributes\" and \"Dynamic Parameters\" under Trading Partner Management. \n\nSince the entity types don't include technology as an allowed category, any products or services mentioned (like Cloud Foundry, Trading Partner Management) shouldn't be emitted as entities. Instead, the changes described should be represented as EVENT entities. \n\nLooking at the records, each has a Title and Description. For Record 4019, the title is \"Custom Search Attributes\" and the description talks about creating custom search attributes for monitoring interchanges. The valid as of date is 2023-10-23. So, I should create an EVENT entity for this, using the title and date. Similarly for Record 4020, the title is \"Dynamic Parameters\" with a description about creating dynamic parameters for company and trading partner profiles. \n\nI need to make sure the event names follow the pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE>. The descriptions should be concise, under 25 words. Also, check if there are any organizations or geographical locations mentioned. The Environment is Cloud Foundry, but since that's a technology environment and not an organization, it's not an entity here. \n\nNo organizations, people, or geos are mentioned in the text, so the only entities will be the two events. Relationships aren't needed here because there's no mention of dependencies or impacts between entities. \n\nSo the output should have two EVENT entities with their respective titles and dates, and no relationships. Let me format them correctly with uppercase entity names and types, and ensure the descriptions are under 25 words.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM SEARCH ATTRIBUTES — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>Enable creation of custom search attributes for monitoring B2B interchanges via Configuration Manager)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DYNAMIC PARAMETERS — 2023-10-23<|>EVENT<|>Allow creation of dynamic parameters for company and trading partner profiles in Trading Partner Management)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926152, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 536, "prompt_tokens": 2923, "total_tokens": 3459, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.15935681286374, "duration": 16.667}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
