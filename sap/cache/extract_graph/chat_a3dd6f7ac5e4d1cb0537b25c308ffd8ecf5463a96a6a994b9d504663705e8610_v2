{"result": {"id": "6db2cade-678b-4184-a076-2a29e92b0e8c", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a bunch of records from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify for entity extraction. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. Let's start with Record 1131. The title is \"New Regions Available\" and the description mentions new regions on Google Cloud: Brazil (São Paulo), Japan (Osaka), Japan (Tokyo), KSA (Dammam). \n\nFor entities, the regions like Brazil (São Paulo) are GEOs. Google Cloud is an ORGANIZATION. The event here is the availability of these new regions, so I'll create an EVENT entity with the name \"NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31\" and a description mentioning the regions and Google Cloud.\n\nNext, Record 1132 talks about new regions on Azure: Canada Central (Toronto), China North 3 (Hebei). Similarly, Azure is an ORGANIZATION, and the regions are GEOs. The EVENT entity here would be \"NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31\" with the respective regions.\n\nRecord 1133 is about an updated account model guidance. Since it's an announcement and doesn't mention specific regions, organizations, or events, there's no entity here. The type is \"Announcement,\" which might not qualify as an event unless it's a new capability. But the description doesn't mention a specific event, so maybe skip this one.\n\nRecord 1134 mentions improvements in SAP Document AI. Since the entity types don't include technology products unless they're part of an event, and the description is about code and stability improvements, this might be an EVENT. The title is \"Overall Improvements,\" so the EVENT entity would be \"OVERALL IMPROVEMENTS — 2025-03-31\" with a description about code and stability.\n\nRecord 1135 is about SAP Dynamic Forms Release 2503. The title is a release, so that's an EVENT. The description includes new features, so the EVENT entity would be \"RELEASE 2503 — 2025-03-28\" with the features listed.\n\nRecord 1136 discusses regional availability for Cloud Identity Services on AWS. The new data center in the US (Virginia) is a GEO, and AWS is an ORGANIZATION. The event is the regional availability, so EVENT entity \"REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27\" with the details. Also, the old data center in Colorado is a GEO, but since it's no longer used, maybe not include it unless specified. The IPs are technical details, not entities.\n\nRecord 1137 introduces a new Microsoft OneDrive Adapter. Since it's a new feature, that's an EVENT. The EVENT entity would be \"NEW MICROSOFT ONEDRIVE ADAPTER — 2025-03-27\" with the description.\n\nRecord 1138 allows displaying verifiable credentials in a form. This is a new feature, so EVENT entity \"DISPLAY VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS — 2025-03-27\" with the description.\n\nNow, relationships. For each EVENT, link to the relevant ORGANIZATION or GEO. For example, the new regions on Google Cloud (EVENT) relates to Google Cloud (ORGANIZATION) and the GEOs. Similarly, the Azure regions relate to Azure and their respective GEOs. The AWS data center relates to AWS (ORGANIZATION) and the GEOs.\n\nI need to make sure all entities are in uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formed with strength between 1-10. Also, check that no invalid entities are included. For example, \"SAP BTP Administrator's Guide\" isn't an entity type allowed, so it's skipped. \n\nDouble-checking each record to ensure compliance with the rules. Avoiding any markdown and following the output format strictly. Finally, list all entities first, then relationships, separated by ##, ending with <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Foundry now supports Brazil (São Paulo), Japan (Osaka), Japan (Tokyo), KSA (Dammam) on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for Cloud Foundry regions)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL (SÃO PAULO)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN (OSAKA)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN (TOKYO)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>KSA (DAMMAM)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Foundry now supports Canada Central (Toronto), China North 3 (Hebei) on Azure)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for Cloud Foundry regions)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>CANADA CENTRAL (TORONTO)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Azure)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA NORTH 3 (HEBEI)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Azure)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>OVERALL IMPROVEMENTS — 2025-03-31<|>EVENT<|>Code and stability improvements for SAP Document AI in Cloud Foundry)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>RELEASE 2503 — 2025-03-28<|>EVENT<|>SAP Dynamic Forms adds form data access, dropdown filtering, and preprocessing capabilities)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services now uses AWS US (Virginia) DC; US (Colorado) DC retired)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for Cloud Identity Services)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES (VIRGINIA)<|>GEO<|>New data center for Cloud Identity Services on AWS)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW MICROSOFT ONEDRIVE ADAPTER — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>Microsoft OneDrive adapter now available for Cloud Foundry integration)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>DISPLAY VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>Admin dashboard displays verified verifiable credentials and presentations)|  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>BRAZIL (SÃO PAULO)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>JAPAN (OSAKA)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>JAPAN (TOKYO)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>KSA (DAMMAM)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>AZURE<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>CANADA CENTRAL (TORONTO)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>CHINA NORTH 3 (HEBEI)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27<|>UNITED STATES (VIRGINIA)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925288, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2062, "prompt_tokens": 3991, "total_tokens": 6053, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 33.46750632993572, "duration": 61.612}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
