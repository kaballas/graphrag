The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided records based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify what's relevant. Let's start with Record 1811. The title is \"Filtered Actions View\" under SAP Build Process Automation. The description mentions adding actions from the smart menu and searching for Remote Function Call (RFC) actions. Since the entity types don't include technology, I should represent this as an EVENT. The valid as of date is 2024-12-05. So the event name would be \"FILTERED ACTIONS VIEW — 2024-12-05\" with a description about the changes in the process editor.\n\nNext, Record 1812 is about Kyma Runtime's Telemetry module update. The description details improvements in traces, metrics, logs, etc. Since this is a change in the module, it's an EVENT. The valid as of date is 2024-12-04. The event name would be \"TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE — 2024-12-04\" with a description about the updates.\n\nRecord 1813 mentions SAP Document AI being available in AWS region ap11 - Asia Pacific (Singapore). Here, AWS is an organization, and Singapore is a geo. The event is the new region availability. So, entities would be \"AWS\" as organization, \"ASIA PACIFIC (SINGAPORE)\" as geo, and the event \"SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN AWS AP11 — 2024-12-04\". Relationships would link the event to AWS and the geo.\n\nRecord 1814 is similar but for Microsoft Azure region ap20 - Australia (Sydney). So, \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as organization, \"AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)\" as geo, and the event \"SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN AZURE AP20 — 2024-12-04\". Relationships between event and both entities.\n\nRecord 1815 talks about notifications in SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition. This is a new feature, so an EVENT. The event name would be \"NOTIFICATIONS ON SAP BUILD WORK ZONE — 2024-12-04\" with the description.\n\nRecord 1816 mentions connecting SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone as a task provider. This is a new feature, so an EVENT. The event name would be \"SAP SUCCESSFACTORS WORK ZONE SUPPORTED AS TASK PROVIDER — 2024-12-04\".\n\nRecord 1817 is about improvements in SAP Task Center. This is a new feature, so an EVENT. The event name would be \"SAP TASK CENTER IMPROVEMENTS — 2024-12-04\" with the description of caching and performance optimizations.\n\nRecord 1818 discusses a change in the behavior of csrf.token.path for SAP Analytics Cloud. This is a change, so an EVENT. The event name would be \"CHANGED BEHAVIOR OF CSRF.TOKEN.PATH FOR SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD — 2024-12-03\".\n\nRecord 1819 is about extending corporate IdPs selection. This is a new feature, so an EVENT. The event name would be \"EXTENDED CORPORATE IDPS SELECTION — 2024-12-03\" with the description.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. For the AWS and Azure events, they involve the respective organizations and geos. The other events don't mention organizations or geos, so no relationships there. Need to ensure all entity types are correct and descriptions are under 25 words. Also, make sure the event names follow the pattern with the date. Finally, list all entities first, then relationships, separated by ## and ending with <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>FILTERED ACTIONS VIEW — 2024-12-05<|>EVENT<|>Process editor now allows direct search for Remote Function Call actions and renamed Browse Library button<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE — 2024-12-04<|>EVENT<|>Traces, metrics, logs improved; Istio trace filtering, metric subselectors, log agent CPU throttling fixes<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN AWS AP11 — 2024-12-04<|>EVENT<|>SAP Document AI now available in AWS ap11 - Asia Pacific (Singapore)<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for SAP Document AI<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>ASIA PACIFIC (SINGAPORE)<|>GEO<|>AWS region where SAP Document AI is now available<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN AZURE AP20 — 2024-12-04<|>EVENT<|>SAP Document AI now available in Microsoft Azure ap20 - Australia (Sydney)<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for SAP Document AI<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)<|>GEO<|>Microsoft Azure region where SAP Document AI is now available<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NOTIFICATIONS ON SAP BUILD WORK ZONE — 2024-12-04<|>EVENT<|>Enable notifications via SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition as central entry point<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS WORK ZONE SUPPORTED AS TASK PROVIDER — 2024-12-04<|>EVENT<|>Connect SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone as task provider to SAP Task Center<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP TASK CENTER IMPROVEMENTS — 2024-12-04<|>EVENT<|>Caching, concurrency optimizations for SAP Task Center service and task providers<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHANGED BEHAVIOR OF CSRF.TOKEN.PATH FOR SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD — 2024-12-03<|>EVENT<|>csrf.token.path property now auto-added only for SAP Analytics Cloud systems via SCIM API v2<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>EXTENDED CORPORATE IDPS SELECTION — 2024-12-03<|>EVENT<|>Support for multiple corporate identity providers via URL parameter<|>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN AWS AP11 — 2024-12-04<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN AWS AP11 — 2024-12-04<|>ASIA PACIFIC (SINGAPORE)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN AZURE AP20 — 2024-12-04<|>MICROSOFT AZURE<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN AZURE AP20 — 2024-12-04<|>AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925844, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1697, "prompt_tokens": 3947, "total_tokens": 5644, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.691196301290695, "duration": 51.91}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Metrics: New MetricPipeline resources now have the subselectors of the runtime input enabled out of the box which means that when you enable the runtime input, all metrics are collected by default (#972).      Metrics: As the annotation-based scraping of Pods running with an Istio sidecar cannot work by design, it is now explicitly not supported. The recommended way to do the scraping is by using annotations on a related service (#1468).      Logs: Improved resource configuration of the log agent no longer triggers CPU throttling alerts in third-party observability solutions (#1601).
