Currently, only IPv4 is supported, therefore in our documentation we had listed only the respective addresses. We have now added also the IPv6 addresses that we plan to use. The enablement of the IPv6 addresses will happen no earlier than February 2026. Until then, please ensure any needed action is performed, based on the information below.Note  Regions for which we haven’t added IPv6 address in the documentation are currently not planned for this activity.  The Connectivity service ingress endpoints are the ones that are called by the Cloud Connector. If the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does not support IPv6, no action is needed, as the IPv4 addresses remain unaffected.  If the network in which your Cloud Connector is running does support IPv6, then the Java virtual machine (JVM) will usually prefer using IPv4 instead of IPv6 (usually controlled via the system property java.net.preferIPv6Addresses). If this is the case for your JVM, again, no action is needed.     Note  As of version 2.18.1, the Cloud Connector shows the IPv6 status on the About screen.    Required Action:  If your JVM is configured to prefer IPv6, you need to verify if you have firewall rules in place that limit outgoing traffic from the network. If this is true, you would have previously allowed the Connectivity service’s IPv4 addresses in order to enable the Cloud Connectors communication with BTP. Now, you need to add also the IPv6 addresses to the allowlist.  For more information, see Cloud Connector: Prerequisites.

The Destination service ingress endpoints are the ones that are called by your HTTP client, accessing its REST API (you would not usually need to take action for this flow, unless you have productive calls to the service from your own network) and the Cloud Connector (only in the cases where automatic token retrieval is performed for an on-premise OAuth destination).
