The user provided a detailed text about various enhancements in SAP systems, and I need to extract entities and relationships based on the given rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the text and identify events. The text mentions several features like adding dimensions to charts, new functions in calculations, improvements in planning, calendar features, and modeling enhancements. Each of these seems like an event because they're new capabilities or changes.\n\nLooking at the entity types: organization, person, geo, event. The text doesn't mention specific organizations, people, or geographical locations. The main entities here are the events related to the features described. \n\nFor example, \"When creating stacked bar/column charts... color feed\" is an enhancement, so that's an event. Similarly, the improvements in planning, calendar, and modeling are all events. Each event needs a name following the pattern \"<SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present>\". However, the text doesn't specify dates, so I'll use \"LATEST REVISION\" as the date placeholder.\n\nNext, check if any products or services are mentioned as entities. The text refers to SAP BPC live data models, SAP Business Accelerator Hub, and others. But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, these shouldn't be entities. Since the user's entity types include organization, and SAP is an organization, but the text doesn't explicitly name other organizations beyond SAP. So maybe SAP is an organization, but the text doesn't mention it explicitly here. Wait, the text does mention \"SAP Business Accelerator Hub\" and \"SAP BPC live data models.\" But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services shouldn't be emitted. However, the user's entity types include organization, so maybe SAP is considered an organization. But the text doesn't explicitly state \"SAP\" as an organization here. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The examples given in the validation section show that products like \"SAP BTP Neo\" are considered organizations if they are explicitly mentioned. But in this case, the text refers to \"SAP Business Accelerator Hub\" and \"SAP BPC live data models.\" However, the user's entity types include organization, so maybe these are considered as part of SAP, which is an organization. But the rules say to emit ORGANIZATION only if explicitly mentioned. Since the text doesn't mention \"SAP\" as an organization directly, maybe they shouldn't be included. Alternatively, if \"SAP Business Accelerator Hub\" is considered an organization, but the rules might not allow that unless it's explicitly named. This might be a case where the product names are not emitted as entities because TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed entity types. Wait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"SAP Business Accelerator Hub\" and \"SAP BPC live data models,\" but these are products/services. Since the user hasn't specified TECHNOLOGY as an allowed entity type, these shouldn't be emitted as entities. Therefore, only events are to be created.\n\nSo, each feature described in the text is an event. For example, \"Enhancements to Chart Dimensions in Optimized Story Experience — LATEST REVISION\" with a description about adding version and other dimensions to color feed. Similarly, other features like \"Planning Improvements with Member Replication\" and so on.\n\nI need to make sure each event is named properly, with the date as \"LATEST REVISION\" since no specific dates are given. Then, check for relationships. Since there are no explicit organizations, people, or geos mentioned, there might be no relationships. The examples show that if there's no relationship, we just output the entities. \n\nSo, the final output will be a list of events with their descriptions, each formatted as per the rules. No relationships since there's no mention of organizations, people, or geos involved in the events.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO CHART DIMENSIONS IN OPTIMIZED STORY EXPERIENCE — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Add version/category dimension and other dimensions to color feed for stacked charts in optimized story experience)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING IMPROVEMENTS WITH MEMBER REPLICATION — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Inner dimension members replicated into new line when using Add Member functionality in planning)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>VERSION MANAGEMENT STEP CONFIGURATION — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Choose automatic publish with restriction handling or discard restricted data in multi actions)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>API STEP CSRF TOKEN SUPPORT — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Require CSRF token checkbox and URL input for external API integration in multi actions)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MULTI ACTIONS SERVICE API AVAILABILITY — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Access Multi Actions Service API features via SAP Business Accelerator Hub)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DATA ACTION PARAMETER ENHANCEMENTS — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Allow \"All Members\" parameter property with member selection/input control/story filter options)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>VALIDATION RULE MEMBER COMBO COPY — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Copy dimension member combinations from Excel or existing rules into validation grids)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ADVANCED FORMULA DIMENSION FILTERS — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Use \"==\" or \"!==\" in IF statements for dimension property-based combination filtering)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUTO-GENERATE PLANNING AREA CONTEXT — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Enable auto-generation of planning area based on table context before editing public versions)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMIZED PLANNING AREA APIs — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Use getPlanningAreaInfo, startEditMode, and copy APIs to customize planning areas)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALENDAR ACTUAL DATES VISUALIZATION — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Display actual event dates alongside planned dates in List workspace and Gantt charts)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CALENDAR EVENT STATUS FILTERING — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Filter calendar events by time-related status (On Track, Delayed, Overdue))  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TIME ZONE DISPLAY FOR CALENDAR TASKS — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Show time zone of calendar task series creation via globe icon in Time section)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD EVENT MANAGEMENT IN PROCESSES — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Add/remove direct child events in process Details panels)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DECOUPLED OCCURRENCE RESET — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Reset decoupled occurrence settings to match series defaults via Details panels or series updates)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TOPERIOD FORMULA FOR AGGREGATION — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Aggregate running totals across flexible time granularities using ToPeriod formula)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FORMULA COMBINATION IN CALCULATED MEASURES — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Combine formulas in calculated measures to reuse LOOKUP, RESTRICT, YOY, SMA, CAGR)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CURRENCY RATES PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS — LATEST REVISION<|>EVENT<|>Optimize performance for large currency rates tables with Data Import API)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923409, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1615, "prompt_tokens": 3846, "total_tokens": 5461, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.119488474771785, "duration": 50.281}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

When creating stacked bar/column charts or stacked area charts in the optimized design experience, you can now add both the version (or category) dimension and other dimensions to the color feed.  When adding the Version (or Category) dimension to the Color section for your chart, you can now choose to use the measures/accounts to set the color and patterns. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.  When creating story calculations based on data from the new model (with an account dimension), you can now use MEMBERLOOKUP and ACCOUNTLOOKUP functions in the calculations. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.  When using a restricted measure calculation that includes a Version dimension, you can now remove the version dimension from the chart axis. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.    Planning improvements:  When you use the Add Member functionality, inner dimension members relative to the member where you trigger this functionality are now automatically replicated and filled into the new line. This enhancement is also available to tables built on SAP BPC live data models.  When configuring a version management step in multi actions, you now have the option to decide how you want your data to publish. You can choose to automatically publish your changes and have the publish fail if there are any restrictions, or you can choose to automatically publish your changes and discard any data that is affected by restrictions.  When configuring the API step of multi actions, you can now select the Require CSRF Token checkbox and enter a CSRF token URL if a CSRF token is required by the external application you want to use.  You can now benefit from the features of Multi Actions Service API on the SAP Business Accelerator Hub.  In data actions, you can now select the checkbox Allow \"All Members\" as a parameter property. Parameters with this property enabled can be used in the source context of different types of data action steps. In data action triggers, you can now choose Member Selection, Input Control, or Story Filter to set values for such parameters using the All Members selection.  In validation rules created by combining dimension members, you can now copy dimension member combinations from other applications like Microsoft Excel or from existing member combinations, and paste them into the validation rule grid, either by using dedicated buttons or via keyboard shortcuts. This helps you quicky add many member combinations into your rule.  In IF statements of advanced formulas, you can now use \"==\" or \"!==\" to define a dimension combination filter that produces a scope of dimension member combinations based on whether or not dimension properties match.  When editing a public version with the recommended planning area defined in the model settings, you can now first select the checkbox Auto-generate based on the table context in the Builder panel of the table you're working on before putting the public version into Edit Mode. The recommended planning area that's applied also takes into account the table context that covers story, page, and table filters. This helps you further restrict the size of the recommended planning area to improve performance, especially for large public versions.  The following Story APIs can now be used to customize the planning area:  As an application designer or story developer in optimized story experience, you can use getPlanningAreaInfo with filter related APIs to define customized planning area. You can further use startEditMode and copy API to edit or copy the customized planning area.  As an application designer or story developer in optimized story experience, you can use startEditMode API to start edit mode on specific planning areas in public versions.  In both analytics designer and optimized story experience, the copy API to now supports the options to create a planning version from visible data and customized planning area.      Calendar improvements:  Next to the planned start and end dates of calendar events, you can now see the actual dates of the events in the List workspace and in the Details panel of an event. Both planned and actual dates are visualized in the Gantt chart. Administrators can turn off the display of the actual dates under System > Administration. For details, see Work in the List Workspace.  To better identify overdue and delayed events, you can now filter your calendar List workspace according to their time-related status (On Track, Delayed, or Overdue). For details, see Filter Calendar Events.  You can now view the time zone in which a calendar task series was created by selecting the globe icon in the Time section of a series or single occurrence. If a series takes place during a daylight-saving time change, it is adjusted accordingly and takes place one hour earlier or later. Note that you need to update existing series to make use of this feature.  Until now, you could add parent processes to events. Now you can also add or remove direct child events in the Details panel of a process. For more information, see Work with Processes.  You can now reset the setting changes of decoupled occurrences so they match the series settings again. You can do this either from the Details panel of the decoupled occurrences, from the Details panel of the series, or when you update the series. For more information, see Working With Series in Work with Calendar Events You Created.    Modeling improvements:  A new ToPeriod formula now allows you to aggregate a running total across flexible time granularities for a given period. This dynamic formula will help modelers create calculated measures using Year-to-Date, Quarter-to-Date and Month-to-Date running totals at a model level, and reuse them in stories. ToPeriod can also be used in combination with LOOKUP or RESTRICT.  You can now combine formulas with other formulas in calculated measures. This improvement will save you time, as you’ll no longer have to create multiple calculated measure to combine LOOKUP, RESTRICT, YOY, SMA & CAGR with other formulas.  Performance improvements are possible for currency rates tables containing large volumes of data.
