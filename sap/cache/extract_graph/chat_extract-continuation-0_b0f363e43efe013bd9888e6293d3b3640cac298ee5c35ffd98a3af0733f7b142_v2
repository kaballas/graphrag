It accepts a map as a value, where all elements in the map are passed directly to the CF API. This mechanism ensures that all future app features will be automatically supported through MTA deployment.  The parameter is especially useful when many services are bound to an application, and all credentials inside the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable exceed the maximum size of 130 KB (see Cloud Foundry environment variables). In this case, the application cannot be staged successfully. To solve that issue, you can switch to the \"\"file-based VCAP services\"\" method by enabling the respective app feature, and adapt your application coding accordingly to use a file instead of the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable. See Delivering service credentials to an app.  For more information about the parameter, see Module-Specific Parameters.\";\"Info only\";\"General Availability\";\"New\";\"Technology\";\"2025-08-21\";\"2025-08-21\";\"2508a\"\n\"SAP Authorization and Trust Management service,SAP BTP Connectivity,SAP Cloud Identity Services\";\"Cloud Foundry,Kyma\";\"Principal propagation from SAP BTP to an On-Premise Cloud Connector with a Token From a Corporate Identity Provider\";\"You have or develop SAP BTP applications which interact with on-premise applications for which you don't want to accept tokens from SAP BTP identity and access management services, namely SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Authorization and Trust Management service.
