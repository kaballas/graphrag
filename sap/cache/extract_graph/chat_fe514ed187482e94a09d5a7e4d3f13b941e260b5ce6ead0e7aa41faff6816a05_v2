The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records are about software changes, they should be events. \n\nLooking at Record 1151: It's about correcting service usage reporting. The title is \"Correct Reporting of Service Usage\" with a valid date of 2025-03-26. So, the event name would be \"CORRECT REPORTING OF SERVICE USAGE — 2025-03-26\". The description should mention the fix for incorrect reporting when certain metrics were requested.\n\nRecord 1152: Title is \"Extension Concept - Properly Write Extension Traces For Wrong Responses\". The valid date is same as 1151. Event name would be \"PROPERLY WRITE EXTENSION TRACES FOR WRONG RESPONSES — 2025-03-26\". Description about fixing the error without writing traces.\n\nRecord 1153: Title is \"Knowledgebases API – Increase Limits of Variant Table API\". Valid date 2025-03-26. Event name \"INCREASE LIMITS OF VARIANT TABLE API — 2025-03-26\". Description about increasing the $skip parameter limit from 4 to 6 digits.\n\nRecords 1154-1158 and 1159-1160 are under Cloud Identity Services and Identity Provisioning. For example, 1154 is about bundle options documentation. The event name would be \"BUNDLE OPTIONS DOCUMENTATION — 2025-03-25\". Description mentions documentation for SAP Field Service Management and Cloud ALM bundles.\n\nRecord 1155: Central store logs display source entity ID. Event name \"CENTRAL STORE LOGS DISPLAY SOURCE ENTITY ID — 2025-03-25\". Description about logs showing the source entity ID.\n\nRecord 1156: Download all updated entities for a provisioning job. Event name \"DOWNLOAD ALL UPDATED ENTITIES FOR A PROVISIONING JOB — 2025-03-25\". Description about enabling download by setting properties.\n\nRecord 1157: OAuth Client Authentication changes. Event name \"OAUTH CLIENT AUTHENTICATION — 2025-03-25\". Description about changing the Add JSON Web Token UI.\n\nRecord 1158: Regular Upgrade of Cloud Identity Services. Event name \"REGULAR UPGRADE — 2025-03-25\". Description about the upgrade.\n\nRecord 1159 and 1160 are similar, about SAP Ariba Applications transformations. They have the same title and valid date. Need to check if they are duplicates. Since they are under different components (Cloud Identity Services vs Identity Provisioning), they might be separate events. But the description is the same, so maybe they are the same event. However, the user might want them as separate entries if the components are different. But the instructions say to emit at least one event per qualifying record. So even if similar, each record is a separate event.\n\nNow, check for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. However, in these records, there's no mention of specific organizations, people, or geos. The environments like Cloud Foundry, Kyma, Neo are part of the environment field but not explicitly mentioned as organizations. Since the rules say not to emit products/services/environments as entities unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. For example, \"Cloud Foundry\" is an environment, not an organization. So no relationships here.\n\nSo, all entities are events, and no relationships to emit. Each record is an event with the title and valid date. Need to format each as (\"entity\"<|>EVENT_NAME<|>EVENT<|>DESCRIPTION). Make sure the entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and valid dates are used.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CORRECT REPORTING OF SERVICE USAGE — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Service usage reporting fixed for knowledgebase metrics, translations, or variant table details requests)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PROPERLY WRITE EXTENSION TRACES FOR WRONG RESPONSES — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Extension traces now log erroneous responses like missing characteristic IDs)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INCREASE LIMITS OF VARIANT TABLE API — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>API $skip parameter limit raised from 4 to 6 digits (max 999,999))  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BUNDLE OPTIONS DOCUMENTATION — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Documentation added for SAP Field Service Management and Cloud ALM bundle options)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL STORE LOGS DISPLAY SOURCE ENTITY ID — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Central store logs now show source entity ID (group ID in Identity Directory))  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOWNLOAD ALL UPDATED ENTITIES FOR A PROVISIONING JOB — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Enable downloading updated entities via ips.trace.updated.entity properties)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>OAUTH CLIENT AUTHENTICATION — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Add JSON Web Token UI updated to support manual issuer or OIDC providers)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REGULAR UPGRADE — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services upgraded to latest version)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP ARIBA APPLICATIONS - DEFAULT TRANSFORMATIONS CHANGES — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Default transformations enhanced with preserveArrayWithSingleElement=true for SAP Ariba)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP ARIBA APPLICATIONS - DEFAULT TRANSFORMATIONS CHANGES — 2025-03-25<|>EVENT<|>Default transformations updated to exclude plant attribute from write/proxy writes for SAP Ariba)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925380, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1389, "prompt_tokens": 3962, "total_tokens": 5351, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.54022570903063, "duration": 44.039}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
