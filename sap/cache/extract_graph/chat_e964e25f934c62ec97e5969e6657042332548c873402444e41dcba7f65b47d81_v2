The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records are about software updates, features, and changes, they should be categorized as events.\n\nLooking at Record 3251: The title is \"Displaying System Label in Search and in App Finder\". The description talks about changes in how the system label is displayed. This seems like a new feature or change, so an EVENT entity. The name would be \"DISPLAYING SYSTEM LABEL IN SEARCH AND APP FINDER — 2024-03-21\" with a description mentioning the locations where the label is displayed.\n\nRecord 3252: \"Filtering Out Empty Spaces and Pages\" is a new feature. The event name would be \"FILTERING OUT EMPTY SPACES AND PAGES — 2024-03-21\" with a description about filtering empty spaces to improve performance.\n\nRecord 3253 and 3254 are about version updates for SAP Java Buildpack. These are changes, so EVENT entities. The titles are \"VERSION 1.90.0\" and \"VERSION 2.4.0\" with dates. Descriptions list the updated components, but the event names should be the version numbers with the valid date.\n\nRecord 3255: \"Custom Certificate Authority\" is a new feature allowing integration with AWS. The event name would be \"CUSTOM CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY — 2024-03-21\" and the description mentions AWS. Since AWS is an organization, that's a relationship.\n\nRecord 3256: \"Show more/less cards in the Insights section\" is a new feature. Event name \"SHOW MORE/LESS CARDS IN INSIGHTS — 2024-03-21\" with the description.\n\nNow, relationships. For the Custom Certificate Authority event, it involves AWS (organization) and the event. So a relationship between the event and AWS with strength 9. Also, the event is part of SAP Secure Login Service, but since the entity types don't include products as entities (unless they are organizations), but SAP Secure Login Service isn't an organization, person, geo, or event. So maybe no relationship there. \n\nOther records don't mention organizations or geos, so no relationships. Need to check if any other events relate to organizations. The Java buildpack updates mention components like Apache Tomcat, but those aren't organizations in the allowed list. So only the AWS relationship in record 3255.\n\nMake sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formatted. Also, check dates and valid as of dates. All records have \"Valid as Of: 2024-03-21\" except 3252 which has \"Latest Revision: 2024-03-14\" but \"Valid as Of: 2024-03-21\". So use the valid as of date for the event date.\n\nNow, structure the output with entities first, then relationships, each separated by ##, ending with <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DISPLAYING SYSTEM LABEL IN SEARCH AND APP FINDER — 2024-03-21<|>EVENT<|>System label now visible in search suggestions, search results, and app finder for Cloud Foundry SAP Build Work Zone<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>FILTERING OUT EMPTY SPACES AND PAGES — 2024-03-21<|>EVENT<|>Empty spaces/pages filtered in New Experience view to improve site performance<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP JAVA BUILDPACK VERSION 1.90.0 — 2024-03-21<|>EVENT<|>Java Buildpack 1 updated to 1.90.0 with component version upgrades<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP JAVA BUILDPACK VERSION 2.4.0 — 2024-03-21<|>EVENT<|>Java Buildpack 2 updated to 2.4.0 with component version upgrades<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY — 2024-03-21<|>EVENT<|>Support for private CA integration via AWS for SAP Secure Login Service<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SHOW MORE/LESS CARDS IN INSIGHTS — 2024-03-21<|>EVENT<|>Insights section now allows toggling between 12 and 100 cards<|>  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CUSTOM CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY — 2024-03-21<|>AMAZON WEB SERVICES<|>Event integrates with AWS private certificate authority<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925908, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1087, "prompt_tokens": 3962, "total_tokens": 5049, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.589654170299333, "duration": 34.41}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
