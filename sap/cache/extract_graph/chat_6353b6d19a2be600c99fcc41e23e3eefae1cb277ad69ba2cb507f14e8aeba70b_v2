The user provided a text about changes in SAP BTP related to Joule and data centers. I need to extract entities and relationships based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, the main text mentions \"formation is created in the System Landscape in SAP BTP\" and talks about the Joule booster. But according to the steps, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, we shouldn't emit products/services. However, the entity types here include ORGANIZATION, PERSON, GEO, EVENT. The text doesn't mention any specific organizations, people, or geos except maybe SAP BTP, but the rules say not to emit products/environments unless they're part of an event. Wait, the first part is about a formation in SAP BTP, but the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. SAP BTP is a product, so maybe it's not an organization. The note about running the booster again might be an event? But the description doesn't have a date. The valid as of is 2024-08-14, but the text doesn't mention an event name. Maybe the \"formation creation\" is an event? But the title isn't clear. Alternatively, the second part about data centers added to client information includes Europe (Netherlands) of Microsoft Azure (EU20), Europe (Frankfurt) of Google Cloud Platform (EU30), etc. These are geos and organizations. So for each data center, we can extract the GEO and ORGANIZATION. For example, \"Europe (Netherlands)\" as GEO, and \"Microsoft Azure\" as ORGANIZATION. Similarly for Frankfurt and Google Cloud Platform. Then, the relationships would link the EVENT (if any) to these entities. But the first part's text doesn't have a clear event name. The second record (Record 110) is about data center availability, which is a new feature. The title is \"Data Center Availability\" with a valid date. So that could be an EVENT. The description lists the added attributes, which are geos and organizations. So the EVENT would be \"DATA CENTER AVAILABILITY — 2024-07-25\" with a description about the added attributes. Then, each GEO and ORGANIZATION mentioned in the description would be entities. For example, \"Europe (Netherlands)\" as GEO, \"Microsoft Azure\" as ORGANIZATION, and so on. Relationships would link the EVENT to each ORGANIZATION and GEO. The relationship descriptions would be like \"Event involves organization's infrastructure\" with strength 9 or 10. Also, check if the first part of the text has any events. The first text mentions \"formation is created\" but no date. Since the valid as of is 2024-08-14, maybe that's the date for an event. But the title isn't given. The user's example C had an event name based on the text. So maybe \"FORMATION CREATION IN SAP BTP — 2024-08-14\" as an EVENT. However, the rules say not to emit products/services unless as events. SAP BTP is a product, so maybe not. But the formation is a system landscape change, which could be an event. However, the user's example D had an event for Joule availability in a data center. So perhaps the formation creation is an event. But the text doesn't mention a specific name. The title isn't provided, so maybe the event name is \"FORMATION CREATION IN SAP BTP — 2024-08-14\" with a description about the formation including Joule and selected systems. However, the note about the booster might not be an event. The user's example C had an event name based on the text. So I'll proceed with that. Then, for the data center part, extract the geos and organizations.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
