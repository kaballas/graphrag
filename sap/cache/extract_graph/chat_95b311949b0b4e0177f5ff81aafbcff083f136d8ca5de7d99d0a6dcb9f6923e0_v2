The user provided some example outputs and specific instructions on how to extract entities and relationships from the given text. The text here is about two records related to Kyma Runtime and Istio module updates.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the text and identify the entities. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. The first part of the text mentions TLS certificates and kubectl, which are technical terms but not entities. The second record talks about updating Istio to version 1.22.1. Since Istio is a technology, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. However, the user's examples show that when a product is updated, it's treated as an event. \n\nLooking at the examples, like Example D where Joule's availability in a data center is an event, and the organization (Microsoft Azure) and geo (Sydney, Australia) are entities. Here, the Istio update would be an event. The component is Kyma Runtime, but since the entity types don't include technology, we can't list Kyma as an organization unless it's explicitly mentioned as a company. However, Kyma is a product by SAP, but the user's examples don't include products as entities unless they are organizations. \n\nSo, the main event here is the Istio module update. The event name should follow the pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE>. The valid as of date is 2024-07-16. The description would be \"Istio module updated to version 1.22.1; see release announcements and change notes.\" \n\nNo organizations, persons, or geos are mentioned in the text, so those entities aren't present. Therefore, only the event entity is emitted. There are no relationships since there's no mention of locations or organizations involved in the event. \n\nI need to make sure the event name is correctly formatted, the description is under 25 words, and the date is correctly taken from \"Valid as Of\". Also, check that no other entities are mistakenly included. Since the user's examples don't include technology products as entities, only the event is valid here.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ISTIO MODULE UPDATE TO VERSION 1.22.1 — 2024-07-16<|>EVENT<|>Istio module updated to version 1.22.1; see release announcements and change notes)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925414, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 540, "prompt_tokens": 2903, "total_tokens": 3443, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.475868500816045, "duration": 17.156}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
