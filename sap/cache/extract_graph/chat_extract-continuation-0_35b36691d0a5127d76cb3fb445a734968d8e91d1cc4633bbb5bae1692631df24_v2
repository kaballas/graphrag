The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. I need to go back through the provided contexts and the real data to find any entities that fit the allowed types: organization, person, geo, event.\n\nFirst, looking at the real data provided. The first text about the index name format change. The event was already extracted as INDEX NAME FORMAT CHANGE. But maybe there's an organization here? The text mentions OpenTelemetry and OpenSearch, but the user's entity types don't include technology as an organization unless it's explicitly named. OpenTelemetry is a project, but maybe it's considered an organization? Wait, the instructions say ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned. OpenTelemetry might be a project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, but unless it's explicitly named as an organization, maybe it's not included. The user's previous example didn't include it, so perhaps it's not an entity here.\n\nNext, the Istio module 1.22 change. The event was extracted as NATIVE SIDECARS... but there's mention of Istio, Kyma, and Kubernetes. Istio is a service mesh, but again, unless it's an organization, it might not be included. Kyma is a product by SAP, so maybe Kyma is an organization? Wait, Kyma is a product, not an organization. The user's example A had DigiCert as an organization. So maybe Kyma isn't an organization here. The environment is Kyma, but that's a product, not an organization. So perhaps no organizations here.\n\nThe tax configuration and traces configuration entries. The component is Application for Data Replication and Administration, but that's a product name, not an organization. The environment is Cloud Foundry, which is an organization (Cloud Foundry Foundation). Wait, Cloud Foundry is mentioned in the contexts as an environment. In the initial contexts, Cloud Foundry is listed as an environment. But according to the entity types, ORGANIZATION must be explicitly mentioned. So Cloud Foundry is an organization? The user's example D had Microsoft Azure as an organization. So Cloud Foundry would be an organization here. Let me check the real data again. In the first record, the environment is Cloud, but in the second record, the environment is Kyma. In the third record, the environment is Cloud Foundry. So Cloud Foundry is an organization. So that's an entity.\n\nSo for the record about Configure External Tax Providers, the environment is Cloud Foundry. So that's an organization. Similarly, the On-request Configuration for Traces is also in Cloud Foundry. So Cloud Foundry should be an entity.\n\nAlso, in the first text, the index names are related to OpenSearch, but OpenSearch is a project, not an organization. Unless it's considered an organization, but the user's examples didn't include it. So maybe not.\n\nLooking at the contexts provided earlier. Context 0, 1, 2, 3 mention SAP Document AI, Migration Assessment, Cloud Foundry, etc. But the user's real data is separate. The user's real data includes Cloud Foundry as an environment, so that's an organization.\n\nSo adding Cloud Foundry as an organization. Also, in the Istio module, Istio is a project, but not an organization. Kyma is a product, not an organization. So maybe only Cloud Foundry is an organization here.\n\nNow, relationships. The event about Configure External Tax Providers is in Cloud Foundry. So the relationship would be between the event and Cloud Foundry. Similarly for the On-request Configuration for Traces.\n\nAlso, the index name change event might be related to OpenSearch, but since OpenSearch isn't an entity, maybe not. The Istio event is related to Kyma Runtime and Kyma, but those are products, not organizations. So maybe only Cloud Foundry as an organization.\n\nSo adding the entities for Cloud Foundry and the relationships between the events and Cloud Foundry.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform for SAP applications and services)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>CONFIGURE EXTERNAL TAX PROVIDERS — 2025-10-22<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Event occurs within this cloud platform environment<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ON-REQUEST CONFIGURATION FOR TRACES — 2025-10-22<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Event occurs within this cloud platform environment<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926595, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 990, "prompt_tokens": 3819, "total_tokens": 4809, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.821668932135395, "duration": 30.163}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you are using the OpenTelemetry logs/metrics feature and rely on the old index suffix on your custom OpenSearch content / queries. In such cases you need to adapt:  Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.    If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern (e.g. metrics-otel-v1-*) instead of targeting individual indexes.      Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.    \nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Announcement\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-10-29\nValid as Of: 2025-10-29\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 18 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: Native sidecars enabled by default with Istio module 1.22\nDescription: With version 1.27, Istio changed the default behavior of attaching Istio sidecar proxy containers, which now run as native sidecars. This approach resolves network connection issues that arise when regular Istio sidecar proxy containers are not ready at the same time as application containers or init containers. Additionally, regular sidecar containers prevent Pods from finishing, for example, in the case of Jobs. If you use the Kubernetes API, an istio-proxy container running as a native sidecar appears in the initContainers list instead of the containers list in a Pod's spec. To learn more, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  To allow more time for Kyma runtime users to adjust to this change, the Istio module in version 1.21 disables the default use of native sidecars. Although Istio module 1.21 installs Istio updated to version 1.27, by default, Istio sidecar proxies are still deployed as regular sidecar containers. With version 1.22 of the Istio module, Istio proxy sidecars will be deployed by default as native sidecars.   The Istio module 1.22 is scheduled to be rolled out to the fast channel on October 8, 2025, and to the regular channel on October 22, 2025.   To use native sidecars before the Istio module 1.22 is released, you must annotate specific Pods or Pod templates with the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"true\".  To continue using regular sidecars instead of native sidecars after the Istio module 1.22 is released, choose one of these solutions:  Disable the use of native sidecars for a particular workload by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"false\" on a Pod or in the Pod template.  Disable the feature globally for all workloads by setting the compatibilityMode field in the Istio CR to true. See Compatibility Mode.  Required action: Test how your application and the tooling (such as automations or monitoring) behave when the Istio sidecar proxy runs as a native sidecar by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"true\" for all your workloads. This is especially important if you have implemented any workarounds for problems caused by the Istio sidecar proxies' lifecycle or if you use automation or monitoring tools to observe the istio-proxy containers. If everything works fine, you can:  Leave the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: \"true\", so that you immediately benefit from native sidecar functionality regardless of the Istio module's upgrades.  Remove the annotation and rely on the default settings.  In case of issues, you can explicitly set the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to \"false\" to use regular sidecar containers until you fix the problem. This guarantees that nothing will change when native sidecars are enabled by default by the Istio module 1.22.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: Deprecated\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-09-05\nValid as Of: 2025-10-22\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 19 ---\nComponent: Application for Data Replication and Administration\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Configure External Tax Providers\nDescription: There is a new screen to configure the connection to external tax providers.

The user provided a set of instructions for extracting entities and relationships from given text, along with examples. The task is to process the \"Real Data\" section and output the entities and relationships according to the specified rules.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The text includes several records, but the main content seems to be about changes in Kyma Runtime related to Istio sidecars and a new configuration for tax providers. However, looking at the examples, the focus is on creating EVENT entities when there's a release, upgrade, or new capability.\n\nStarting with the first part about the index names changing. The text mentions a new format for logs and metrics index names, removing the date suffix and using a six-digit number instead. This is a change in the system, so it should be an EVENT. The valid as of date is 2025-10-29. The entity name would be something like \"INDEX NAME FORMAT CHANGE — 2025-10-29\". The description should mention the new format and the impact on users relying on old suffixes.\n\nNext, looking at Record 18 about Kyma Runtime and Istio module 1.22 enabling native sidecars by default. This is a significant change, so it's an EVENT. The title is \"NATIVE SIDECARS ENABLED BY DEFAULT WITH ISTIO MODULE 1.22 — 2025-10-22\" (using the valid as of date from the record). The description should explain the change in default behavior and the required actions for users.\n\nRecord 19 introduces a new screen for configuring external tax providers in the Application for Data Replication and Administration. This is a new feature, so another EVENT. The entity name would be \"CONFIGURE EXTERNAL TAX PROVIDERS — 2025-10-22\" with a description about the new screen and its current support for US taxes.\n\nRecord 20 allows on-request configuration for traces instead of tenant-wide. This is a new capability, so another EVENT. The entity name would be \"ON-REQUEST CONFIGURATION FOR TRACES — 2025-10-22\" with a description about enabling traces on request.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The first EVENT about index names doesn't mention any organizations, geos, or other events, so no relationships. The Istio module change (Record 18) involves Kyma Runtime and Istio, but according to the rules, products/services aren't entities unless explicitly mentioned as organizations. Since Kyma and Istio are part of the environment (Cloud Foundry, Kyma Runtime), but the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. So, maybe no relationships here. The tax provider configuration (Record 19) and trace configuration (Record 20) also don't mention other entities, so no relationships to emit.\n\nWait, the user's examples sometimes include relationships between events and organizations. For instance, in Example D, the event is linked to Microsoft Azure. But in the current data, the events are about features within SAP systems, so unless there's an explicit organization mentioned, like SAP BTP or Microsoft Azure, there might not be relationships. The text mentions \"Kyma Runtime\" and \"Istio module,\" but these are products, not organizations. So, no relationships would be emitted here.\n\nSo, the final output would be four EVENT entities with their descriptions, and no relationships since none of the events are linked to organizations, geos, or other events as per the rules.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>INDEX NAME FORMAT CHANGE — 2025-10-29<|>EVENT<|>Logs/metrics index names now use six-digit numeric suffix instead of date; affects OpenTelemetry users relying on old format)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE SIDECARS ENABLED BY DEFAULT WITH ISTIO MODULE 1.22 — 2025-10-22<|>EVENT<|>Istio sidecars now run as native containers by default; requires application testing and configuration adjustments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CONFIGURE EXTERNAL TAX PROVIDERS — 2025-10-22<|>EVENT<|>New screen added for external tax provider configuration; currently supports US taxes only)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ON-REQUEST CONFIGURATION FOR TRACES — 2025-10-22<|>EVENT<|>Traces for configuration/pricing services can now be enabled on-request instead of tenant-wide)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
