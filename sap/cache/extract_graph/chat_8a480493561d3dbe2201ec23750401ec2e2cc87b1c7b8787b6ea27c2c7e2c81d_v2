This is a reminder that the range will start to be used from October 8, 2025.   Actions:      If your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules, please adapt your configuration before October 8, 2025 by allowlisting the specified NAT IP address range.   Remove the following IP ranges from allowlisting between October 20, 2025 and October 24, 2025 if your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules. This is necessary because these IP ranges will be released from SAP and returned to AWS for redistribution, which changes their availability. Removing these ranges helps prevent unauthorized access\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8a480493561d3dbe2201ec23750401ec2e2cc87b1c7b8787b6ea27c2c7e2c81d_v2"}
