The user provided some SAP \"What's New\" entries and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the text for each record. The first record is about CSRF Protection for Dynamic Destinations in SAP Build Work Zone. The key points here are the new security measure, the component, and the environment. Since the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and the component is a technology, which isn't in the allowed list, I should represent this as an EVENT. The event name would be something like \"CSRF PROTECTION FOR DYNAMIC DESTINATIONS — 2024-04-18\" with a description about the new security measures.\n\nNext, the second and third records are about SAP Java Buildpack versions 1.93.0 and 2.6.0. These are version updates, which are changes. Since the component is a buildpack, which is a technology, I can't emit it as an organization. So, these updates should be events. The event names would be \"SAP JAVA BUILDPACK 1.93.0 — 2024-04-18\" and \"SAP JAVA BUILDPACK 2.6.0 — 2024-04-18\" with descriptions about the version updates and components changed.\n\nI need to check if there are any organizations, geos, or persons mentioned. The environments are Cloud Foundry, but that's a technology, so not an organization. The components are SAP Java Buildpack, which is a product, not an organization. So no organizations here. No named individuals or locations mentioned, so no person or geo entities. \n\nFor relationships, since there are no organizations or geos involved, there are no relationships to emit. Each event is standalone. \n\nI need to make sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and follow the format. Also, check that the valid as of date is used. The first record's valid as of is 2024-04-18, same for the others. \n\nSo the output should have three events and no relationships. Let me structure them properly with the correct formatting.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CSRF PROTECTION FOR DYNAMIC DESTINATIONS — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>New security measures enable approuter to enforce CSRF protection for dynamic destinations via CEP.EnableCsrfProtection property<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP JAVA BUILDPACK 1.93.0 — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Updated Apache Tomcat 9, TomEE 7, PostgreSQL JDBC, and SAP HANA Driver versions in SAP Java Buildpack 1<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP JAVA BUILDPACK 2.6.0 — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Updated Apache Tomcat 10, PostgreSQL JDBC, and SAP HANA Driver versions in SAP Java Buildpack 2<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923367, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 684, "prompt_tokens": 3265, "total_tokens": 3949, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.77109944725719, "duration": 21.529}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.

It’s assumed that backends behind the destinations, handle CSRF protection on their own.   New security measures have been introduced to enable CSRF protection by the approuter. This is done by setting the CEP.EnableCsrfProtection property to true for all dynamic destinations where their respective backend doesn’t handle CSRF protection.  If your backend is already protected, there’s no need to add this property. \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-04-18\nValid as Of: 2024-04-18\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3119 ---\nComponent: SAP Java Buildpack\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Version 1.93.0\nDescription: SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been updated from version 1.92.0 to 1.93.0.
