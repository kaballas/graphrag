The user provided some data from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The main text here is about ABAP Environment updates. There are two records: Record 279 and 280. Both are under the ABAP Environment component, part of the ABAP environment, with General Availability lifecycle and valid as of 2025-08-15.\n\nLooking at the entity types allowed: organization, person, geo, event. The instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY isn't in those types, we shouldn't emit products/services as entities but represent changes as EVENT entities. However, in the examples, even when the entity is a product (like Joule), they were treated as EVENT. Wait, in Example D, Joule was an EVENT, but Microsoft Azure was an ORGANIZATION. So maybe when the main subject is a product or service, it's considered an EVENT, but if the entity is an organization, that's separate.\n\nFor Record 279: Title is \"Manage Software Components\". The description talks about changes to the delete dialog for Bring Your Own Git. The action is Info only, lifecycle is General Availability, type is New. The valid as of date is 2025-08-15. So this seems like a new feature or change, which should be an EVENT. The entity name would be \"MANAGE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS — 2025-08-15\" as the event. The description would mention the modification to the delete dialog and the Unregister button change.\n\nRecord 280: Title is \"New CDS Views in Business Event Logging\". The description lists new CDS views released. This is a change (type Changed), so again, an EVENT. The entity name would be \"NEW CDS VIEWS IN BUSINESS EVENT LOGGING — 2025-08-15\". The description would list the CDS views added.\n\nNow, checking for organizations, persons, geos. The text mentions ABAP Environment, which is a product, but since the entity types don't include TECHNOLOGY, we shouldn't emit products as entities. So ABAP Environment isn't an entity here. The other parts don't mention any organizations, persons, or geos. So the only entities are the two events.\n\nRelationships: Since there are no organizations, geos, or persons involved in these events, there are no relationships to extract. The examples sometimes have relationships between events and organizations, but here, the events are about features in ABAP Environment, which isn't an entity. So no relationships.\n\nI need to make sure the event names are correctly formatted with the title and date. Also, the descriptions are under 25 words. Let me check the word counts. For Record 279: \"The delete dialog for Bring Your Own Git has been modified. The Unregister repository checkbox within the dialog has been moved outside the dialog and changed to a separate Unregister button.\" That's 25 words. For Record 280: \"The following CDS views have been released: C_BUEVLGEVTFULLPYLDJSONDEX_2: Business Event Data v2, C_BUSEVTLOGACTIVITYDEX: Business Event Activity, C_BUSEVTLOGEVENTDEX_3: Business Event Header Data (v3).\" That's 25 words. \n\nSo the output should have two events, no relationships. Let me structure them as per the examples.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>MANAGE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS — 2025-08-15<|>EVENT<|>Modified delete dialog for Bring Your Own Git; Unregister button moved outside dialog<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CDS VIEWS IN BUSINESS EVENT LOGGING — 2025-08-15<|>EVENT<|>Released CDS views: C_BUEVLGEVTFULLPYLDJSONDEX_2, C_BUSEVTLOGACTIVITYDEX, C_BUSEVTLOGEVENTDEX_3<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926521, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 884, "prompt_tokens": 3018, "total_tokens": 3902, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.921424186617553, "duration": 27.693}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
