The user provided a set of release notes from SAP and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to parse each record and determine what entities and relationships are present.\n\nStarting with the first record about Istio 1.26.1 and 1.26.0. The text mentions EnvoyFilters not created by the API Gateway module's RateLimit being detected. The key here is that this is a change in the system, so it should be an EVENT. The entity name would be something like \"ENVOYFILTERS DETECTION BY API GATEWAY RATELIMIT — 2025-07-24\" since the Valid as Of date is 2025-07-24. The description should mention the detection and the warning state. No organizations or geos here, so only the event.\n\nNext, the Monitoring Service REST APIs record. The change is adding a rate limit per subaccount. This is another EVENT. The name would be \"MONITORING REST API RATE LIMIT PER SUBACCOUNT — 2025-07-24\". The description includes the rate limit change and the status code 429. Again, no organizations or geos, just the event.\n\nThird record is about Multitarget Applications for Cloud Foundry. The new parameter skip-deploy allows skipping module deployment. This is a new feature, so an EVENT. The name would be \"NEW MODULE-SPECIFIC SKIP-DEPLOY PARAMETER — 2025-07-24\". The description mentions the parameter and its use. Here, \"CLOUD FOUNDRY\" is an environment, but according to the rules, environments aren't entities unless they're organizations. Since Cloud Foundry is a platform, maybe it's an organization? Wait, the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. Cloud Foundry is a service provided by SAP, so maybe it's an organization. But the user's examples didn't include that. Wait, looking back at the examples, in Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So Cloud Foundry might be considered an organization here. But the user's instruction says to emit ORGANIZATION only if explicitly mentioned as a company, institution, or service provider. The text mentions \"Cloud Foundry\" as the environment, but is it an organization? Maybe not, since it's a platform. Hmm, this is tricky. The user's examples have \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as an organization. So if the text mentions \"Cloud Foundry\" as a service, perhaps it's an organization. But I need to check if the rules allow that. The rules say ORGANIZATION must be explicitly mentioned. The text here says \"Multitarget Applications for Cloud Foundry\" but the environment is Cloud Foundry. However, in the examples, \"Cloud Foundry\" wasn't treated as an organization. For example, in Context 0, \"Cloud Foundry\" is part of the component but not an organization. So maybe in this case, \"CLOUD FOUNDRY\" isn't an organization. Therefore, the event is the only entity here.\n\nFourth record is about SAP BTP Cockpit's Events page improvements. This is a change, so an EVENT. The name would be \"SPACE EVENTS PAGE IMPROVEMENTS — 2025-07-24\". The description lists the improvements. Again, no organizations or geos, just the event.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The first three events don't mention any organizations or geos, so no relationships. The fourth event also doesn't mention any. So no relationships to extract. \n\nWait, the user's examples sometimes have relationships between events and organizations. For example, in Example D, the event is linked to Microsoft Azure and Sydney, Australia. But in the current data, none of the events mention organizations or geos. So no relationships here. \n\nSo the final output would be four events and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVOYFILTERS DETECTION BY API GATEWAY RATELIMIT — 2025-07-24<|>EVENT<|>EnvoyFilters not created by API Gateway RateLimit now trigger Istio CR warning state)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MONITORING REST API RATE LIMIT PER SUBACCOUNT — 2025-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Monitoring REST APIs now enforce rate limits per subaccount with 429 status code)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW MODULE-SPECIFIC SKIP-DEPLOY PARAMETER — 2025-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Skip-deploy parameter added to exclude modules during Cloud Foundry application deployment)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SPACE EVENTS PAGE IMPROVEMENTS — 2025-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Cockpit space events page renamed, columns updated, and load performance improved)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926941, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1067, "prompt_tokens": 3196, "total_tokens": 4263, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.84409227922524, "duration": 33.507}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
