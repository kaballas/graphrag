The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP release notes based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. \n\nLooking at the first record, it's about increasing the document limit in Joule's pipelines. Since it's a change, that's an event. The title would be \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING PIPELINE LIMIT INCREASE — 2025-09-25\". The description mentions the max number of documents per pipeline. \n\nNext, record 2 adds support for images and tables in PDFs. Another event: \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR PDF CONTENT — 2025-09-25\". Description includes the new features.\n\nRecord 3 talks about enhanced use cases in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. The event name would be \"ENHANCED PRCM USE CASES — 2025-09-23\". The description lists the changes made.\n\nRecord 4 is an enhancement to view leave balance. Event name: \"VIEW LEAVE BALANCE ENHANCEMENT — 2025-09-23\". Description mentions the enhancement details.\n\nRecord 5 introduces Joule for SAP Logistics Management. Event: \"JOULE FOR SAP LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT — 2025-09-23\". Description states the new use cases.\n\nRecord 6 is about managing business partner certificates. Event name: \"BUSINESS PARTNER CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT — 2025-09-23\". The description lists the supported use cases.\n\nRecord 7 allows Joule to release supplier invoices. Event: \"SUPPLIER INVOICE RELEASE IN SAP S/4HANA — 2025-09-23\". Description explains the new capability.\n\nRecord 8 adds new use cases for cash and liquidity management. Event: \"CASH AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT USE CASES — 2025-09-23\". Description lists the new features.\n\nRecord 9 is about new use cases in Sales for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Event: \"SALES USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA — 2025-09-23\". Description includes the transactional capabilities.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. Since most of these are events related to Joule and SAP products, but the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Joule is a component, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity, we don't emit it. However, the events themselves are the main entities here. There's no mention of organizations, people, or geos in the descriptions except for SAP S/4HANA Cloud editions, which are part of SAP, an organization. Wait, in the examples, when a product is mentioned, like Microsoft Azure, it's considered an organization. But in the current data, the SAP products are part of SAP, which is an organization. However, the user's examples didn't include SAP as an organization in the output. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So if the text mentions SAP S/4HANA Cloud, which is a product of SAP, but the entity type for organization is only for the company itself. So SAP would be the organization. However, in the given records, the line of business is Technology, but the actual organizations mentioned are SAP S/4HANA Cloud editions, which are products, not organizations. Therefore, since the user's rules state that products/services/environments should not be emitted as entities unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed, but in this case, the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. Since TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed list, we don't emit products. Therefore, the only entities are the events. \n\nSo, no relationships are needed because there are no organizations, people, or geos mentioned in the descriptions. All the events are standalone. Therefore, the output will be the list of events without any relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING PIPELINE LIMIT INCREASE — 2025-09-25<|>EVENT<|>Document grounding now allows 3000 documents per pipeline for content ingestion)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING SUPPORT FOR PDF CONTENT — 2025-09-25<|>EVENT<|>Document grounding now supports images and tables embedded in PDF files)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCED PRCM USE CASES — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>Enhanced transactional use cases for Product Lifecycle Management in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>VIEW LEAVE BALANCE ENHANCEMENT — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>Enhanced View leave balance use case in SAP SuccessFactors)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE FOR SAP LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports transactional, navigational, and informational use cases in SAP Logistics Management)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS PARTNER CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>New use cases for managing business partner certificates in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLIER INVOICE RELEASE IN SAP S/4HANA — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>Joule can now release blocked supplier invoices in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CASH AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT USE CASES — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>New use cases for displaying cash positions and making bank transfers in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SALES USE CASES IN SAP S/4HANA — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>New transactional Joule capabilities for solution quotation management in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921338, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1352, "prompt_tokens": 3551, "total_tokens": 4903, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 35.768142014339006, "duration": 37.799}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
