Support for populating dropdown dataset from Form Instance XML:  Using MAIF's pre-processing, Form Instance dropdown controls can now be initialized with S/4 data.      Support for passing user information into offline forms in SAP Service and Asset Manager:  By using the XPath formula xxf:user-name(), the user's email address can now also be passed into an offline form when filling it out in the SAP Service and Asset Manager application. This allows you to identify internal and external employees on the form.

Note: As part of the migration, new workers are created, and the existing worker nodes are drained (application Pods evicted) and removed. To minimize disruption to your workloads, it is advisable to ensure the availability of your applications by running multiple replicas across different Availability Zones and configuring Pod Disruption Budgets.  Note: The v1 Endpoints API is now officially deprecated (though still fully supported). The API will not be removed, but you should start using the EndpointSlice API instead.\";\"Recommended\";\"General Availability\";\"Announcement\";\"Technology\";\"2025-09-23\";\"2025-10-17\";\"Cloud\"\n\"Authorization and Trust Management Service\";\"ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other\";\"Replacement of Library for JSON Web Tokens (JWT)\";\"With this release, we replace the library for JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
