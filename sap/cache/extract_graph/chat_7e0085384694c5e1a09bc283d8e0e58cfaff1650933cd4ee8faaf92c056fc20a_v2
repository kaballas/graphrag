The user provided some records from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the text and identify the relevant parts. The text includes several records from different components, all related to Joule in various SAP modules. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nLooking at the first part of the text: \"or change WBS Element in Project Builder or show in WBS Element App using WBS Element ID or Description...\". This seems to be a feature addition, but the description is a bit unclear. However, the key info is the \"Valid as Of\" date, which is 2024-12-13. Since the action is \"Info only\" and lifecycle is General Availability, this is a new feature. But the title isn't provided here, so I need to check if there's a title in the records. Wait, the user's real data includes records 88, 89, 90. Let me check those.\n\nRecord 88: Title is \"New Use Cases Now Supported in Service for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\". The description lists new use cases. Valid as Of is 2024-12-13. So this is an event. The entity name would be \"NEW USE CASES IN SERVICE FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-12-13\" as the event. The description would mention the supported use cases.\n\nRecord 89: Title is \"Use Cases Now Supported in Asset Management for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\". Valid as Of same date. So another event entity.\n\nRecord 90: Title is \"Use Cases Now Supported in Revenue Accounting and Reporting in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\". Valid as Of 2024-12-13. Another event.\n\nNow, checking the entity types. The events are about new use cases in different SAP modules. Since the entity types include EVENT, these qualify. The other parts of the text (like the WBS Element part) don't have a clear title or event, so maybe they are part of the same records? Wait, the initial text before the records might be part of another record. But the user's real data starts with the records. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's real data starts with a line that seems to be part of a record, but it's not properly formatted. Maybe that's a typo. The first line after \"Text:\" is \"or change WBS Element in Project Builder or show in WBS Element App using WBS Element ID or Description...\" which might be part of a record's description. However, without a title or component, it's unclear. But the following lines are properly formatted records 88, 89, 90. \n\nAssuming that the initial text is part of a record that's not properly formatted, but the user's examples show that each record is processed. However, the user's instruction says to process the given text, which includes those lines. But since the records 88-90 are properly formatted, I'll focus on those. \n\nFor each of these records, I need to create an EVENT entity. The titles are the main part. For example, Record 88's title is \"New Use Cases Now Supported in Service for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\". The valid as of date is 2024-12-13. So the event name would be \"NEW USE CASES IN SERVICE FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-12-13\". The description would be the use cases listed: \"Fetch service confirmation details, fetch reference objects\".\n\nSimilarly for Record 89: \"USE CASES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-12-13\" with the use cases listed. And Record 90: \"USE CASES IN REVENUE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-12-13\" with the listed capabilities.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The events are related to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, which is an organization? Wait, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition is a product, but the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, products/services aren't emitted as entities. So the events are standalone. However, the line of business is \"Technology\" in some cases, but that's not an entity. \n\nWait, the user's examples show that when TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services are not emitted. So in this case, the events are about new use cases in different modules of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. But since the product name isn't an entity (as it's a technology), we don't emit it. Therefore, there are no relationships to other entities. \n\nSo the output would be three EVENT entities, each with their respective titles and descriptions, and no relationships. \n\nI need to make sure the entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and formatted correctly. Also, check if any of the records have other entities, but based on the given data, it's just the events.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN SERVICE FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-12-13<|>EVENT<|>New transactional use cases supported: fetch service confirmation details, fetch reference objects<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>USE CASES IN ASSET MANAGEMENT FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-12-13<|>EVENT<|>New transactional use cases supported: display maintenance orders, notifications, jobs, and perform activities<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>USE CASES IN REVENUE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2024-12-13<|>EVENT<|>New navigational capabilities: manage revenue accounting items, contracts, schedules, and reconcile contracts<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921776, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1363, "prompt_tokens": 2778, "total_tokens": 4141, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 35.614433905568184, "duration": 38.271}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
