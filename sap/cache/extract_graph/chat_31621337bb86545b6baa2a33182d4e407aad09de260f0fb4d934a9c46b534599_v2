The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP release notes based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the component is Joule and the environment is Cloud Foundry, but TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed entity types, so I shouldn't emit products/services as entities. Instead, represent changes as EVENT entities.\n\nLooking at Record 61: The title is \"Electronic Document Error Explanations\" with a valid date of 2025-04-25. The description mentions new features in the Manage Electronic Documents app. So, the event name would be \"ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT ERROR EXPLANATIONS — 2025-04-25\" with a description about natural language interaction for error explanations.\n\nRecord 62: Title is \"New Analytical Insights Capability in Joule with SAP Analytics Cloud\". Valid as Of is 2025-04-25. The description mentions integration with SAP Analytics Cloud. Since SAP Analytics Cloud is an organization, that's an entity. The event would be \"ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS CAPABILITY IN JOULE — 2025-04-25\" and the organization \"SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD\".\n\nRecord 63: Title is \"New Transactional Capabilities Now Supported in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition\". Valid as Of 2025-04-25. The event name would be \"TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-04-25\". Since SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition is a product, but it's not an allowed entity type, so we don't emit it as an organization. Instead, the event is the main entity.\n\nRecord 64: Title is \"New Use Cases Now Supported for Subscription Order Management in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\". Valid as Of 2025-04-18. The event name would be \"SUBSCRIPTION ORDER MANAGEMENT USE CASES — 2025-04-18\". Again, the product name isn't an entity, so just the event.\n\nRecord 65: Title is \"New Use Cases Now Supported in Service for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\". Valid as Of 2025-04-18. Event name: \"SERVICE USE CASES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-04-18\".\n\nRecord 66: Title is \"Joule in SAP BTP cockpit\". Valid as Of 2025-04-04. The description mentions SAP BTP cockpit, which is an organization. So the event is \"JOULE IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-04-04\" and the organization \"SAP BTP COCKPIT\".\n\nRecord 67: Title is \"Joule Multi Language Support\". Valid as Of 2025-04-04. The event name would be \"JOULE MULTI LANGUAGE SUPPORT — 2025-04-04\".\n\nNow, relationships. For each event, check if there's a connection to an organization or geo. For example, in Record 62, the event involves SAP Analytics Cloud, so a relationship between the event and the organization. Similarly, in Record 66, the event is related to SAP BTP Cockpit as an organization. \n\nNeed to ensure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are under 20 words with strength between 1-10. Also, check for any GEOs, but in these records, there's no mention of specific locations, so no GEO entities. \n\nMake sure not to include any products as entities since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed. All events are correctly named with the date. Relationships are only between events and organizations where applicable.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT ERROR EXPLANATIONS — 2025-04-25<|>EVENT<|>Natural language interaction with Joule to explain electronic document errors and provide resolution steps)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS CAPABILITY IN JOULE — 2025-04-25<|>EVENT<|>Joule integrates with SAP Analytics Cloud to provide conversational data insights via charts and metrics)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Analytics platform enabling conversational data insights in Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-04-25<|>EVENT<|>Joule supports creating fixed asset master data in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Finance)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUBSCRIPTION ORDER MANAGEMENT USE CASES — 2025-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Joule enables creating/searching subscription orders and summarizing contracts in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE USE CASES FOR SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Joule supports searching/service orders, releasing items, and navigating service order details)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-04-04<|>EVENT<|>Joule available in SAP BTP cockpit for querying BTP resources, users, and Cloud Foundry environments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP COCKPIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platform administration interface where Joule provides resource and user management insights)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE MULTI LANGUAGE SUPPORT — 2025-04-04<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports localized messages and product data in multiple languages)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS CAPABILITY IN JOULE — 2025-04-25<|>SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD<|>Event leverages organization's analytics platform<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-04-04<|>SAP BTP COCKPIT<|>Event occurs within this platform administration interface<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921497, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1467, "prompt_tokens": 3533, "total_tokens": 5000, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 35.597291985149596, "duration": 41.211}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
