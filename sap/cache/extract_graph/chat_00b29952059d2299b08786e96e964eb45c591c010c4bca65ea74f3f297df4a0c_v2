The user provided a text about upgrades in Joule related to a new conversational experience and another about document grounding with OAuth2ClientCredentials. They want entities and relationships extracted based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, check the entity types: organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"SAP SuccessFactors\" and \"SAP BTP cockpit\". SAP SuccessFactors is an organization, and SAP BTP is also an organization. The other parts are about features and updates, which should be events.\n\nFor the first part: \"Upgraded to New Conversational Experience in Joule\" with Valid as Of 2025-01-27. That's an EVENT. The description mentions upgrading use cases, so the event name would be \"NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE UPGRADE — 2025-01-27\". The description should mention the upgrade and the new experience.\n\nNext, the second record: \"Document Grounding Capability - Support to Destination Configuration with OAuth2ClientCredentials Authentication\" with Valid as Of 2025-01-13. This is a new feature, so another EVENT. The name would be \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING WITH OAUTH2CLIENTCREDENTIALS — 2025-01-13\". The description includes support for OAuth2ClientCredentials in destination configurations.\n\nNow, relationships. The first event involves SAP SUCCESSFACTORS as the organization providing the platform. The second event involves SAP BTP as the organization providing the cockpit. So relationships between each event and their respective organizations. The strength would be around 8 or 9 since they are direct involvements.\n\nCheck if any GEOs or PERSONs are mentioned. Doesn't look like any. So only the two events and two organizations. No relationships between events or other entities. Make sure all entity names are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. Relationships are between events and organizations, describing the involvement.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE UPGRADE — 2025-01-27<|>EVENT<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS upgraded all remaining Joule use cases to new conversational experience<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HR software platform providing upgraded Joule conversational experience<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING WITH OAUTH2CLIENTCREDENTIALS — 2025-01-13<|>EVENT<|>Joule document grounding now supports OAuth2ClientCredentials in SAP BTP cockpit configurations<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform enabling OAuth2ClientCredentials authentication for Joule document grounding<|>  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE UPGRADE — 2025-01-27<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>Event involves organization's platform upgrade<|>9)  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING WITH OAUTH2CLIENTCREDENTIALS — 2025-01-13<|>SAP BTP<|>Event utilizes organization's authentication protocol<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921199, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 699, "prompt_tokens": 2516, "total_tokens": 3215, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 39.40470150515812, "duration": 17.739}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
