The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the given text based on the provided guidelines. First, I need to parse the input text and identify the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the first part of the text: \"Upgraded to New Conversational Experience in Joule\". The key points here are the upgrade to a new conversational experience in Joule. The valid as of date is 2025-01-27. According to the steps, I need to create an EVENT entity. The name should be something like \"NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE UPGRADE — 2025-01-27\". The description would mention the upgrade in SAP SuccessFactors, introducing a new transactional use case and upgrading existing ones. The entity type is EVENT.\n\nNext, the second record mentions \"Document Grounding Capability - Support to Destination Configuration with OAuth2ClientCredentials Authentication\". This is a new feature, so another EVENT entity. The name could be \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY OAUTH2CLIENTCREDENTIALS SUPPORT — 2025-01-13\". The description would state that the capability now supports OAuth2ClientCredentials authentication when creating a destination configuration in SAP BTP cockpit. The valid as of date here is 2025-01-13.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. The text mentions SAP SuccessFactors and SAP BTP. These are organizations, so I need to create entities for them. SAP SUCCESSFACTORS as ORGANIZATION with a description about the HR platform. SAP BTP as another ORGANIZATION, described as a cloud platform for business applications.\n\nFor relationships, the first event (New Conversational Experience) involves SAP SUCCESSFACTORS, so a relationship where the event occurs in the organization. The second event (Document Grounding) involves SAP BTP, so another relationship linking the event to the organization. The strength for both would be around 9, as they are direct involvements.\n\nI need to ensure all entity types are correct, no invalid ones. GEO isn't mentioned, so no need for that. PERSON isn't present either. The descriptions are under 25 words. Relationships are correctly formed with the right strength. Finally, format everything as specified, using uppercase for entity names and types, and separate with ##. End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE UPGRADE — 2025-01-27<|>EVENT<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS upgraded Joule to new conversational experience; all use cases updated<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY OAUTH2CLIENTCREDENTIALS SUPPORT — 2025-01-13<|>EVENT<|>Joule's document grounding now supports OAuth2ClientCredentials authentication in SAP BTP cockpit<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HR platform providing upgraded conversational experience for Joule<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform enabling OAuth2ClientCredentials authentication for document grounding<|>  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE UPGRADE — 2025-01-27<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS<|>Event involves organization's platform upgrade<|>9)  \n(\"relationship\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY OAUTH2CLIENTCREDENTIALS SUPPORT — 2025-01-13<|>SAP BTP<|>Event utilizes organization's authentication framework<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925643, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 782, "prompt_tokens": 2884, "total_tokens": 3666, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 30.887115885930957, "duration": 25.318}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
