{"result": {"id": "36b94f66-b858-488e-afdb-c6b6f680ffc6", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about SAP BTP ABAP environment features and wants entities and relationships extracted based on the given rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the text. The main points are about a feature being opt-in, a setting SPACES_HIDE_EMPTY_SPACES_PAGES, and changes in future releases (2505 and 2508). Also, there's a new feature to display open transport requests.\n\nLooking at the entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFor the first part, the feature activation and default settings. The key event here is the change in default settings for the SPACES_HIDE_EMPTY_SPACES_PAGES. The note mentions SAP plans to activate the feature by default in 2505 release. So that's an EVENT. The name should be something like \"SPACES_HIDE_EMPTY_SPACES_PAGES DEFAULT CHANGE — 2025-02-14\" since Valid as Of is 2025-02-14. The description would mention the setting being default false, changing to true in 2505, and removal in 2508.\n\nAnother event is the new feature to display open transport requests. The title is \"How to Display Open Transport Requests\" with Valid as Of 2025-02-14. So EVENT name: \"DISPLAY OPEN TRANSPORT REQUESTS — 2025-02-14\". Description: \"Display open transport requests by searching a table in Manage Software Components app.\"\n\nCheck for organizations. The text mentions SAP BTP ABAP environment, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services shouldn't be entities. But the entity types here include organization, so maybe SAP BTP is considered an organization? Wait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The note says \"SAP plans to activate...\" so SAP is an organization. So \"SAP BTP\" as ORGANIZATION. Description: \"Cloud platform providing ABAP environment with feature management.\"\n\nAlso, the ABAP Environment 2502 version is mentioned. But since TECHNOLOGY is allowed here (as per the user's entity types), but the rules say if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products. Wait, the user's entity_types include organization, so maybe ABAP Environment is a product, but the rules say when TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, don't emit products. However, in this case, the user's entity_types include organization, so maybe ABAP Environment is part of SAP BTP, which is an organization. But the text says \"ABAP Environment 2502\" which is a version. But according to the rules, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed. Wait, the user's entity_types are organization, person, geo, event. The instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" But in this case, the user's entity_types include organization, so maybe SAP BTP is considered an organization. So \"SAP BTP\" as ORGANIZATION.\n\nFor relationships: The event about SPACES_HIDE_EMPTY_SPACES_PAGES is related to SAP BTP as the organization managing the feature. So relationship between the event and SAP BTP with description \"Event involves organization's feature management\" and strength 9. Similarly, the DISPLAY OPEN TRANSPORT REQUESTS event is also related to SAP BTP.\n\nCheck for GEOs and PERSONs. There's no mention of specific people or places, so those can be dropped.\n\nNow, structure the entities and relationships accordingly, ensuring all names are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. Relationships should link events to SAP BTP as the organization.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SPACES_HIDE_EMPTY_SPACES_PAGES DEFAULT CHANGE — 2025-02-14<|>EVENT<|>Feature default setting changes: false (current) → true (2505 release); setting removed in 2508 release<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>DISPLAY OPEN TRANSPORT REQUESTS — 2025-02-14<|>EVENT<|>Display open transport requests via table search in Manage Software Components app<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing ABAP environment with feature management capabilities<|>  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPACES_HIDE_EMPTY_SPACES_PAGES DEFAULT CHANGE — 2025-02-14<|>SAP BTP<|>Event involves organization's feature management<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISPLAY OPEN TRANSPORT REQUESTS — 2025-02-14<|>SAP BTP<|>Event involves organization's feature implementation<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925954, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1047, "prompt_tokens": 2966, "total_tokens": 4013, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.956655859485664, "duration": 31.769}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
