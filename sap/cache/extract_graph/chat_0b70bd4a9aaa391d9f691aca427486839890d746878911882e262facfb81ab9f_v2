The user provided a text about a new feature in SAP Build Process Automation called \"Advanced Functions for Decisions\" with SUBSTRING and STRINGREPLACE functions. The task is to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps.\n\nFirst, check the entity types allowed: organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"SAP Build Process Automation\" and \"Cloud Foundry\". But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, products/services/environments shouldn't be entities. However, the user's example D included \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as an organization. Wait, in the current text, \"Cloud Foundry\" is an environment, but the entity types don't include technology. So, should I emit \"SAP Build Process Automation\" as an event?\n\nWait, the instruction says: \"Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\" The text here is about new functions added, which is a new capability. So the main event is the addition of these functions. The title is \"Advanced Functions for Decisions\" with the date 2025-01-27. So the event name would be \"ADVANCED FUNCTIONS FOR DECISIONS — 2025-01-27\".\n\nNext, check if there are any organizations, geo, or persons. The component is \"SAP Build Process Automation\" and environment is \"Cloud Foundry\". But since the entity types don't include technology, these shouldn't be emitted as entities. However, \"SAP Build Process Automation\" might be a product, but the rules say not to emit products/services/environments as entities when TECHNOLOGY is not allowed. Wait, the user's example D included \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as an organization, which is a service provider. So maybe if the text explicitly mentions an organization, it's allowed. But in this case, the text doesn't mention any organization beyond the product name. So perhaps no organizations here.\n\nSo the only entity is the event. Then, relationships: are there any? The event might involve an organization if there's one mentioned, but there isn't. So no relationships. Therefore, the output should be just the event entity.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVANCED FUNCTIONS FOR DECISIONS — 2025-01-27<|>EVENT<|>Added SUBSTRING and STRINGREPLACE functions for decisions in SAP Build Process Automation<|>25-01-27)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925990, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 545, "prompt_tokens": 2763, "total_tokens": 3308, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.323112508154914, "duration": 16.861}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
