The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the user mentioned that if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. Looking at the records, most of them are about changes, new features, or updates, so they should be events.\n\nStarting with Record 2301: \"Changes to Metering and Pricing for Premium Edition\" under SAP Document AI. The description mentions a change in how field counts are calculated. This is a change, so it's an event. The event name would be \"CHANGES TO METERING AND PRICING FOR PREMIUM EDITION — 2024-09-09\". The description should mention the update to field count calculation.\n\nRecord 2302: \"Combine Different Setup Types for Line Items in Schema (Premium Edition)\" – another change. Event name would be \"COMBINE DIFFERENT SETUP TYPES FOR LINE ITEMS IN SCHEMA — 2024-09-09\". Description about using different extraction methods for line items.\n\nRecord 2303: Certification of MySQL 8.0 as a source. This is a new feature, so an event. Name: \"CERTIFICATION OF MYSQL 8.0 AS SOURCE — 2024-09-06\". Description about MySQL 8.0 being certified.\n\nRecord 2304: Documentation update about OData V2 Function Import. This is a change, so event. Name: \"DOCUMENTATION UPDATE ON ODATA V2 FUNCTION IMPORT — 2024-09-06\". Description mentions the clarification in documentation.\n\nRecord 2305: New field for DB2 iSeries Datastores. New feature, event. Name: \"NEW FIELD FOR DB2 I SERIES DATASTORES — 2024-09-06\". Description about the new connection field.\n\nRecord 2306: Release update with performance improvements. No new features, but it's an announcement. Still, it's an event. Name: \"RELEASE UPDATE FOR DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICE — 2024-09-06\". Description about performance improvements.\n\nRecord 2307: General Availability of SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Extensibility Wizard. New feature, event. Name: \"GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF SAP S/4HANA PUBLIC CLOUD EXTENSIBILITY WIZARD — 2024-09-06\". Description about creating extensions.\n\nRecord 2308: New command in SAP AI Core Catalog. New feature, event. Name: \"NEW COMMAND IN SAP AI CORE CATALOG — 2024-09-05\". Description about the GenerateGpt4OmniCompletion command.\n\nRecord 2309: HTML5 Business Solutions – Multitenancy Support. Changed, so event. Name: \"HTML5 BUSINESS SOLUTIONS MULTITENANCY SUPPORT — 2024-09-05\". Description about cross subaccount access.\n\nRecord 2310: Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes - Bug Fixes. This is a bug fix, which is an event. Name: \"TRANSPARENT PROXY FOR KUBERNETES BUG FIXES — 2024-09-05\". Description about the bug fixes in version 1.6.0.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry, Neo, Kyma. These are part of SAP's environments, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, we don't emit products/services/environments as entities. However, the user's entity types include organization, and the examples sometimes include organizations like Microsoft Azure. But in the given records, the environments are part of SAP's offerings. However, the rules say if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, we don't emit them. Wait, the user's entity types here are organization, person, geo, event. The TECHNOLOGY here refers to the component names like SAP Document AI, but the rules say if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products/services. But in the examples, like Example D, Microsoft Azure is an organization. So maybe if the environment is an organization, like Cloud Foundry, but Cloud Foundry is a product of SAP, so maybe it's considered a service, not an organization. However, the user's examples include \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as an organization. So perhaps in this case, the environments like Cloud Foundry, Neo, Kyma are not organizations but services, so they shouldn't be emitted as entities. Therefore, no organizations here except maybe SAP itself, but the records don't mention SAP as an organization explicitly. So maybe no organizations to emit.\n\nGEOs: None of the records mention specific locations, so no GEO entities.\n\nPersons: No named individuals mentioned, so no PERSON entities.\n\nRelationships: Since there are no organizations or GEOs, there are no relationships to emit. All events are standalone.\n\nNow, formatting each entity as per the rules. Each event's name is in uppercase, type is EVENT, and the description is concise. Then, relationships are only if there are entities, but since there are none, no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CHANGES TO METERING AND PRICING FOR PREMIUM EDITION — 2024-09-09<|>EVENT<|>Field count calculation for SAP Document AI now includes schema categories as single fields)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>COMBINE DIFFERENT SETUP TYPES FOR LINE ITEMS IN SCHEMA — 2024-09-09<|>EVENT<|>SAP Document AI now supports mixed extraction methods for line item fields in schemas)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFICATION OF MYSQL 8.0 AS SOURCE — 2024-09-06<|>EVENT<|>MySQL 8.0 certified for use as a source in Cloud Integration for Data Services tasks/dataflows)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENTATION UPDATE ON ODATA V2 FUNCTION IMPORT — 2024-09-06<|>EVENT<|>Clarified OData V2 function import limitations when OData version is set to AUTO)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW FIELD FOR DB2 I SERIES DATASTORES — 2024-09-06<|>EVENT<|>DB2 iSeries 7.4 certification added new connection information field for datastores)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>RELEASE UPDATE FOR DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICE — 2024-09-06<|>EVENT<|>Performance improvements made with no new features added in this release)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF SAP S/4HANA PUBLIC CLOUD EXTENSIBILITY WIZARD — 2024-09-06<|>EVENT<|>Wizard enables creation of on-stack and side-by-side extensions for SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW COMMAND IN SAP AI CORE CATALOG — 2024-09-05<|>EVENT<|>GenerateGpt4OmniCompletion command added to SAP AI Core catalog for generative AI use)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>HTML5 BUSINESS SOLUTIONS MULTITENANCY SUPPORT — 2024-09-05<|>EVENT<|>Cross-subaccount access enabled for multitenant HTML5 business solutions in Cloud Portal Service)>  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSPARENT PROXY FOR KUBERNETES BUG FIXES — 2024-09-05<|>EVENT<|>Transparent Proxy v1.6.0 fixes SAP BTP address field parsing issues in Kubernetes environments)>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925980, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1723, "prompt_tokens": 3950, "total_tokens": 5673, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.94014185481866, "duration": 52.307}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
