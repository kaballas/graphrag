The user provided a text about a new function module in ABAP Test Cockpit and wants entities and relationships extracted based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the text. The main points are the introduction of RS_ABAP_GET_NAMETAB_INFOS_E, SAP Note 2270689, SAP BTP system, satellite systems, cloud connectors, and ABAP Environment 2402. \n\nLooking at entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nStarting with EVENT entities. The text mentions a new function module and new versions of notes, which are new capabilities. So, I should create an EVENT for the new function module. The valid as of date is 2024-02-16, so the event name would be \"NEW FUNCTION MODULE RS_ABAP_GET_NAMETAB_INFOS_E — 2024-02-16\". The description should mention the function module, SAP Note 2270689, and the action required for SAP BTP users.\n\nNext, check for ORGANIZATION. SAP BTP is mentioned, which is a known organization. So, \"SAP BTP\" as ORGANIZATION with a description about the cloud platform.\n\nFor the note, SAP Note 2270689 is a document, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity type, it should be part of the EVENT description, not an entity.\n\nGEO isn't mentioned here, so no GEO entities. PERSON isn't mentioned either.\n\nRelationships: The EVENT involves SAP BTP as the organization providing the system. So, a relationship between the event and SAP BTP with a description like \"Event involves organization's system\" and strength 8.\n\nAlso, the function module is part of ABAP Environment 2402. But ABAP Environment is a product, not an entity type allowed unless it's an organization. Since ABAP Environment isn't an organization, it's part of the EVENT description. So no entity for that.\n\nCheck if all entities are valid. SAP BTP is an organization, the event is correctly formed. No other entities. Relationships only between the event and SAP BTP.\n\nMake sure descriptions are under 25 words and entity names are uppercase. Relationships are under 20 words with strength between 1-10.\n\nFinal check: No invalid entities, correct types, proper formatting with ## and <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW FUNCTION MODULE RS_ABAP_GET_NAMETAB_INFOS_E — 2024-02-16<|>EVENT<|>New function module introduced with updated source code extractor notes in SAP Note 2270689; requires updates to SAP BTP satellite systems and cloud connector allow lists)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing central ATC check system infrastructure for ABAP Environment)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW FUNCTION MODULE RS_ABAP_GET_NAMETAB_INFOS_E — 2024-02-16<|>SAP BTP<|>Event involves organization's central ATC check system<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926689, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 693, "prompt_tokens": 2971, "total_tokens": 3664, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.95168057540689, "duration": 21.689}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
