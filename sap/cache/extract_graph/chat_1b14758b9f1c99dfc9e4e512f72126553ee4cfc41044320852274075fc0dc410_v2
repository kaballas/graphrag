The user provided some real data from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The text has three records (2348, 2349, 2350) each with details about different components and updates. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nStarting with Record 2348: The title is \"New Diagnostics Feature\" for Edge Integration Cell in Cloud Foundry. The description mentions running diagnostic tasks. According to the steps, since this is a new feature, it should be an EVENT. The name should be \"NEW DIAGNOSTICS FEATURE — 2024-08-24\" using the Valid as Of date. The description would be about the diagnostics feature for troubleshooting.\n\nNext, Record 2349: Title is \"Software Version Update\" for Edge Integration Cell. The description states the version 8.20.* with increment 2407. This is another EVENT. The name would be \"SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2024-08-24\" and the description mentions the version update.\n\nRecord 2350: Title is \"Envelopes in MIGs\" under Integration Advisor. The description allows including envelopes in MIGs for certain standards. This is a Changed type, so it's an EVENT. The name would be \"ENVELOPES IN MIGS — 2024-08-24\" with the description about adding envelopes in MIG creation.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The events are related to the components (Edge Integration Cell, Integration Advisor) and environments (Cloud Foundry, Neo). However, the rules state that products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities unless they are organizations. Cloud Foundry and Neo are environments, but they aren't organizations. So, no relationships here. The events are standalone as they don't mention specific organizations, people, or geos. \n\nEach event is correctly named and described, and since there's no mention of organizations, people, or geos, no relationships are formed. All entities are events. I need to make sure the entity names are uppercase, types are correct, and descriptions are under 25 words. Also, check that the dates are correctly taken from \"Valid as Of\" or \"Latest Revision\" if needed. \n\nNo issues found with the data. All three records are converted into events without any relationships. The output should list the three entities followed by <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW DIAGNOSTICS FEATURE — 2024-08-24<|>EVENT<|>Run diagnostic tasks to troubleshoot Edge Integration Cell; see Diagnostics documentation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2024-08-24<|>EVENT<|>Edge Integration Cell updated to version 8.20.* with increment 2407)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENVELOPES IN MIGS — 2024-08-24<|>EVENT<|>Include envelopes in Message Implementation Guidelines for ASC X12, UN/EDIFACT, and Odette)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923317, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 714, "prompt_tokens": 3085, "total_tokens": 3799, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.619123760793094, "duration": 21.889}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
