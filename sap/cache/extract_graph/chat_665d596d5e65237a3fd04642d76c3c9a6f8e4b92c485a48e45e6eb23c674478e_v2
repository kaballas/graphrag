The user provided some examples of how to extract entities and relationships from text based on specific rules. Now, they want me to apply those rules to the given \"Real Data\" section.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The text has two records. Let's look at each one.\n\nStarting with the first record: \"annel Promotion Pricing Apps (trial). The previously known links are currently still working but not recommended for usage. A prompt switch to the new links is highly recommended.\" The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nLooking for events here. The mention of \"trial\" might be part of the event name. The key point is the change in links, so maybe an event about the promotion pricing apps being in trial. The valid as of date is 2024-04-24. So the event name could be \"ANNEL PROMOTION PRICING APPS TRIAL — 2024-04-24\". The description would mention the trial status and the recommendation to switch to new links. \n\nNext, check if any organizations, persons, or geos are mentioned. \"ANNEL\" might be an organization, but the examples didn't have such cases. The user's examples didn't include organizations unless explicitly named like Microsoft Azure. Since \"ANNEL\" isn't a known organization, maybe it's part of the event name. The rest of the text doesn't mention any other entities, so no other entities here.\n\nNow the second record: \"Component: SAP Omnichannel Promotion Pricing Environment: Cloud Foundry Title: Enhance Search with Customer and Vendor Name for Business Units in Maintain Promotions App Description: You can now search for business units Customer and Vendor using their names in the Maintain Promotions application.\" Valid as Of: 2024-04-24.\n\nThis is a new feature, so an event. The title can be the event name: \"ENHANCE SEARCH WITH CUSTOMER AND VENDOR NAME FOR BUSINESS UNITS IN MAINTAIN PROMOTIONS APP — 2024-04-24\". The description would state the enhancement allowing search by names. \n\nCheck for entities. \"SAP OMNICHANNEL PROMOTION PRICING\" is a product, but since the entity types don't include technology, it shouldn't be an entity. \"CLOUD FOUNDRY\" is an environment, but again, not in the allowed types. So no organizations, persons, or geos here. \n\nNow relationships. The first event might relate to \"ANNEL PROMOTION PRICING APPS\" as part of the event, but since we didn't extract that as an organization, maybe no relationships. The second event doesn't have any other entities either. So no relationships to emit.\n\nWait, the first record's event name includes \"ANNEL PROMOTION PRICING APPS TRIAL\". But \"ANNEL\" might be a typo for \"SAP\" or another organization. However, without explicit mention of a known organization, it's safer not to include it. The user's examples didn't have such cases, so maybe it's just part of the event name.\n\nSo the output would be two events with their descriptions, no entities other than the events, and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNEL PROMOTION PRICING APPS TRIAL — 2024-04-24<|>EVENT<|>Trial version of Promotion Pricing Apps; existing links functional but not recommended; transition to new links advised)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCE SEARCH WITH CUSTOMER AND VENDOR NAME FOR BUSINESS UNITS IN MAINTAIN PROMOTIONS APP — 2024-04-24<|>EVENT<|>Maintain Promotions app now allows searching business units by customer/vendor names)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926730, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 808, "prompt_tokens": 2852, "total_tokens": 3660, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.498089530627844, "duration": 24.863}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
