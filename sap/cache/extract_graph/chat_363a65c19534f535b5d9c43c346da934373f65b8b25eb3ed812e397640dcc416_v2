The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. Each record seems to be a new feature or change in SAP Build Work Zone. Since the entity types don't include technology, any product or service mentioned (like SAP Build Work Zone) shouldn't be entities but part of the event description.\n\nLooking at Record 3111: The title is \"Public Workspace: Access for Non-Member External Users.\" The valid as of date is 2024-04-18. So, the event name would be \"PUBLIC WORKSPACE ACCESS FOR NON-MEMBER EXTERNAL USERS — 2024-04-18\". The description mentions external users can't search but can be added to access policy. That's the event description.\n\nRecord 3112: Title is \"Removal of External Workspace Type\". Valid as of same date. Event name: \"REMOVAL OF EXTERNAL WORKSPACE TYPE — 2024-04-18\". Description about external workspaces becoming private and the warning icon.\n\nRecord 3113: \"Role-Based Filtering of Cards\" — event name with date. Description about cards assigned to roles based on user roles.\n\nRecord 3114: \"Support Custom SMTP Configuration\" — event name. Description allows customers to use their own SMTP settings.\n\nRecord 3115: \"Support of Cards as App Visualization Type\" — event. Description about cards being a visualization type in Content Manager.\n\nRecord 3116: \"Support of Custom Domains in Private Networks\" — event. Description mentions opening a support ticket for custom domains.\n\nRecord 3117: \"System Info on the Overview Page\" — event. Enhanced overview page with info for support tickets.\n\nRecord 3118: \"CSRF Protection for Dynamic Destinations\" — event. New security measures for CSRF protection.\n\nNow, check for organizations, geo, or persons. The text mentions SAP Build Work Zone, Cloud Foundry, but those are products/environments, not allowed as entities. No specific organizations, people, or geos mentioned except maybe Cloud Foundry, but that's an environment. So no other entities except the events.\n\nRelationships: Since there are no other entities (org, person, geo), there are no relationships to extract. So the output will be the list of events without relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC WORKSPACE ACCESS FOR NON-MEMBER EXTERNAL USERS — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>External users added to access policy can explore workspaces, be invited, and view member content)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>REMOVAL OF EXTERNAL WORKSPACE TYPE — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>External workspaces converted to private with warning icon; external users invited via admin settings)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED FILTERING OF CARDS — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Cards assigned to roles and accessible based on user roles via Content Manager)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORT CUSTOM SMTP CONFIGURATION — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Customers can configure custom SMTP servers instead of default settings in Admin Console)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORT OF CARDS AS APP VISUALIZATION TYPE — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Cards now supported as visualization type in Content Manager; manual uploads disabled)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORT OF CUSTOM DOMAINS IN PRIVATE NETWORKS — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Custom domains in private networks require support ticket for configuration)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM INFO ON THE OVERVIEW PAGE — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Overview page enhanced with additional info for support tickets)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>CSRF PROTECTION FOR DYNAMIC DESTINATIONS — 2024-04-18<|>EVENT<|>Approuter now enables CSRF protection via CEP.EnableCsrfProtection property)|  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923354, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 927, "prompt_tokens": 3918, "total_tokens": 4845, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.57356948228883, "duration": 29.36}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

When you create a new workspace, you can choose between creating a public workspace or a private workspace.  Existing external workspaces will become private workspaces and an External warning icon will be added to the workspace header to indicate that the content of this workspace is visible to external users.  You can invite external users to both private and public workspaces. To do that, when you create a new workspace (or when you edit the admin settings of an existing workspace), you need to choose the option \"External users can access this workspace and be invited as members\". Note that the invited external users should already be added to the system prior to the invitation. For more information about external users, seeAbout External Users  If the workspace setting \"Allow users to request to join this workspace\" is enabled, users can request to join this workspace by going to Workspaces  View All Workspaces   Explore Workspaces and clicking Join Workspace next to the workspace name. Alternatively, they can open the workspace and click the Join button at the top right.  \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-03-14\nValid as Of: 2024-04-18\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3113 ---\nComponent: SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Role-Based Filtering of Cards\nDescription: With the transition to the Content Manager as the card management tool, all cards will be assigned to roles and will be accessible at runtime based on user roles.\nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-04-18\nValid as Of: 2024-04-18\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3114 ---\nComponent: SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Support Custom SMTP Configuration\nDescription: Customers can choose to use their own SMTP server settings instead of the default settings.
