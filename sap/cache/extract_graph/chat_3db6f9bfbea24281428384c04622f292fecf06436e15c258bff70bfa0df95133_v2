The user provided some SAP \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The text has three records from SAP Build Work Zone. Let me go through each one.\n\nStarting with Record 489: \"App Catalogs Displayed\". The description mentions that when adding apps to a page, users can now see a list of app catalogs, and selecting a catalog filters the results. This sounds like a new feature, so I should create an EVENT entity. The title is \"App Catalogs Displayed\", and the Valid as Of date is 2025-07-10. The EVENT name would be \"APP CATALOGS DISPLAYED — 2025-07-10\". The description should mention the ability to see app catalogs and filter results.\n\nNext, Record 490: \"Defining Custom Themes\". The description talks about enhancing the Local Entry Point guide to include integrating with the UI Theme Designer service. This is a change, so another EVENT. The title is \"Defining Custom Themes\", and the date is the same. The EVENT name would be \"DEFINING CUSTOM THEMES — 2025-07-10\". The description should note the enhancement to the guide for custom themes.\n\nNow, checking the entity types. The examples show that when TECHNOLOGY isn't an entity type, changes are represented as EVENTS. Here, the components are \"SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition\" and \"Cloud Foundry\". But according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, products/services aren't emitted as entities. Since the user's entity types include organization, person, geo, event, and the components here are products, they shouldn't be entities. So only the EVENTS are created.\n\nNo organizations, people, or geos are mentioned in the text, so no other entities. Relationships would require connections between entities, but since there are no other entities besides the EVENTS, there are no relationships to extract.\n\nI need to make sure the EVENT names are correctly formatted with the date and the description is under 25 words. Also, check that all entity types are uppercase and valid. Then output the entities followed by relationships, using the specified format.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>APP CATALOGS DISPLAYED — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>Page editor now shows app catalogs; selecting a catalog filters displayed apps<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DEFINING CUSTOM THEMES — 2025-07-10<|>EVENT<|>Local Entry Point guide updated to include UI Theme Designer integration for custom themes<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926443, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 596, "prompt_tokens": 3081, "total_tokens": 3677, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.751105428586648, "duration": 18.771}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.

A cleaner look and feel – only when hovering a section/cell/widget, the relevant settings and borders of that element are displayed.       When adding content to a workpage, there is a separation between tiles and card/widgets. If a certain cell is already populated with one type of content, the content finder will allow the user to select and add only the same type of content to this cell.      Removing the last content item in a cell will directly remove the column that contains this cell.    \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2025-07-10\nValid as Of: 2025-07-10\nVersion: 2506B\n\n--- Record 489 ---\nComponent: SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: App Catalogs Displayed\nDescription: When using the page editor to add apps to a page, you can now see a list of app catalogs.
