The user provided a set of instructions for extracting entities and relationships from some technical documentation. The goal is to parse the given text and output entities and relationships according to the specified rules.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the input text. There are three records here, each with details about different components in SAP environments. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. \n\nStarting with Record 378: It's about SAP Ariba Central Invoice Management supporting userUUID. The key points here are the component name and the new feature. Since the user instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we should represent changes as EVENT entities. However, the component here is \"Identity Provisioning\" under Environment Neo. But the main event here is the support for userUUID. However, the user instructions mention that products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. Since SAP Ariba is a product, but the allowed entity types don't include technology, so maybe we need to create an EVENT for this enhancement. The title is \"SAP Ariba Central Invoice Management supports userUUID\", so the event name could be \"SAP Ariba CENTRAL INVOICE MANAGEMENT USERUUID SUPPORT — 2025-07-29\". The description would mention the support for userUUID and the enhancements to handle the UUID.\n\nNext, Record 379: Kyma Runtime allowing custom OIDC configuration. The title is \"Custom OIDC configuration as a list of oidc objects\". This is a new feature, so an EVENT entity. The event name would be \"CUSTOM OIDC CONFIGURATION AS LIST OF OIDC OBJECTS — 2025-07-28\". The description would note the ability to have multiple OIDC configs and the added fields.\n\nRecord 380: New provisioning parameter Colocate Control Plane. The title is \"New provisioning parameter: Colocate Control Plane\". This is another new feature, so an EVENT. The event name would be \"COLOCATE CONTROL PLANE PROVISIONING PARAMETER — 2025-07-28\". The description would mention enforcing control plane location in the same region as worker nodes.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The events are related to the environments (Neo, Kyma) and possibly organizations like SAP BTP. However, the user instructions say to emit relationships only if there's a clear dependency. For example, the event involving Kyma Runtime might relate to SAP BTP as the organization. But the text mentions \"SAP BTP cockpit\" in Record 379, so that's an organization. So, for the OIDC event, the relationship would be between the event and SAP BTP. Similarly, the Colocate Control Plane event might relate to Kyma Runtime, but since Kyma is a product, and the allowed entity types don't include technology, maybe not. Wait, the user instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services aren't emitted as entities. So Kyma Runtime isn't an entity. So the only relationships would be between the events and the organizations mentioned, like SAP BTP.\n\nSo, for Record 379, the event \"CUSTOM OIDC CONFIGURATION...\" would have a relationship with SAP BTP as the organization. The strength would be around 8 or 9. Similarly, the Colocate Control Plane event might relate to SAP BTP as well, but the text doesn't explicitly mention an organization. The SAP BTP cockpit is mentioned, so that's an organization. So that's a possible relationship.\n\nNow, checking the entity types. The events are correctly named with the date. The organizations would be SAP BTP, SAP Ariba, etc., but the user instructions say to only emit organizations that are explicitly mentioned. SAP Ariba is a product, so maybe not an organization. SAP BTP is an organization. So in Record 379, the mention of SAP BTP cockpit would make SAP BTP an organization entity. Similarly, in Record 380, if there's a mention of SAP BTP, but I don't see it. The text says \"Kyma Environment\" and \"SAP BTP cockpit\" in Record 379. So SAP BTP is an organization.\n\nSo, the entities would be the three events and SAP BTP as an organization. The relationships would link the events to SAP BTP. Let me structure that.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP Ariba CENTRAL INVOICE MANAGEMENT USERUUID SUPPORT — 2025-07-29<|>EVENT<|>SAP Ariba Central Invoice Management now supports userUUID provisioning with enhanced transformations for universally unique identifiers>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM OIDC CONFIGURATION AS LIST OF OIDC OBJECTS — 2025-07-28<|>EVENT<|>Kyma runtime now allows multiple OIDC configurations via list of oidc objects with requiredClaims and groupsPrefix fields>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLOCATE CONTROL PLANE PROVISIONING PARAMETER — 2025-07-28<|>EVENT<|>New parameter enforces control plane location in same region as worker nodes for sensitive data management>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing infrastructure for Kyma runtime and SAP Ariba integration>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUSTOM OIDC CONFIGURATION AS LIST OF OIDC OBJECTS — 2025-07-28<|>SAP BTP<|>Event involves configuration in SAP BTP cockpit<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COLOCATE CONTROL PLANE PROVISIONING PARAMETER — 2025-07-28<|>SAP BTP<|>Event relates to Kyma runtime on SAP BTP<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925986, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1254, "prompt_tokens": 3183, "total_tokens": 4437, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.56212510711225, "duration": 38.511}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
