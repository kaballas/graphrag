The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records are about new features, changes, and updates, they should be considered events. \n\nLooking at Record 3151: It's about a new license type for an application. The event name would be \"KERNEL-SERVICE LICENSE TYPE — 2024-04-09\" with a description mentioning the new read-only license type. No organizations or geos here, so no relationships.\n\nRecord 3152: Label changes for restricting print data and URLs. Event name \"RESTRICT PRINT DATA AND OPENING URLs LABEL CHANGES — 2024-04-09\". Description about allowing non-iOS users. No entities beyond the event.\n\nRecord 3153: Sample back-end version change to OData 4. Event name \"SAMPLE BACK-END VERSION CHANGE — 2024-04-09\". Description about default version change. No entities.\n\nRecord 3154: Testing back-end connectivity with allowed paths. Event name \"TEST BACK-END CONNECTIVITY — 2024-04-09\". Description about easier testing. No entities.\n\nRecord 3155: Web application option removed. Event name \"WEB APPLICATION OPTION REMOVAL — 2024-04-09\". Description about removal from dialogs. No entities.\n\nRecord 3156: Accessibility improvements in SAP Build Apps. Event name \"ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS — 2024-04-09\". No other entities.\n\nRecords 3157-3159: Generative AI hub updates. Each has event names like \"GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2024-04-08\" with descriptions about GCP Vertex AI models and context window. No entities here either.\n\nRecord 3160: Workspaces supporting x.509 certificates. Event name \"WORKSPACES X.509 CERTIFICATE SUPPORT — 2024-04-08\". No entities.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. None of the events mention organizations, geos, or people, so no relationships to emit. All events are standalone. \n\nI need to make sure all entity names are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. Also, ensure that only the allowed entity types are used. Since none of the records mention specific organizations, people, or geos beyond the event itself, the output will only have events with no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>KERNEL-SERVICE LICENSE TYPE — 2024-04-09<|>EVENT<|>New read-only license type for single-app cockpit SaaS applications in Cloud Foundry Mobile Services<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>RESTRICT PRINT DATA AND OPENING URLs LABEL CHANGES — 2024-04-09<|>EVENT<|>Labels now allow restricting printing/URL access for non-iOS users in Mobile Services<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAMPLE BACK-END VERSION CHANGE — 2024-04-09<|>EVENT<|>OData sample back-end default changed to Version 4 (Version 2 still available)<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>TEST BACK-END CONNECTIVITY — 2024-04-09<|>EVENT<|>Allowed Paths configuration enables path selection during OData destination testing<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>WEB APPLICATION OPTION REMOVAL — 2024-04-09<|>EVENT<|>Web app template removed from Create New App dialogs in Mobile Services<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS — 2024-04-09<|>EVENT<|>UI element accessibility enhancements in SAP Build Apps<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2024-04-08<|>EVENT<|>GCP Vertex AI models supported in SAP AI Core and Launchpad<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2024-04-08<|>EVENT<|>32k context window available for compatible generative models<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>WORKSPACES X.509 CERTIFICATE SUPPORT — 2024-04-08<|>EVENT<|>x.509 certificate-based connections enabled in SAP AI Launchpad Workspaces<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926797, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1025, "prompt_tokens": 3955, "total_tokens": 4980, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 33.09013429752066, "duration": 30.976}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
