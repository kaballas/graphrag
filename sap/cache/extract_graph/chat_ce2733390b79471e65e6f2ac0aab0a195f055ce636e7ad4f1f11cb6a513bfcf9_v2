The user provided a text about Joule enhancements in SAP SuccessFactors and wants entities and relationships extracted based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the text. The main entity here is the enhancement to Joule, which is an EVENT. The title mentions \"Enhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors\" and the Valid as Of date is 2024-04-03. So the EVENT name should be \"ENHANCEMENTS TO JOULE IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-04-03\". The description should summarize the changes: direct display of single name matches, removal of inactive users in certain views, and the default image fix for oversized uploads.\n\nNext, check for other entities. The text mentions \"SAP SUCCESSFACTORS\" but since the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and SAP SuccessFactors is a product, not an organization, it's not included. The other parts don't mention any organizations, people, or geos. So no other entities to extract.\n\nFor relationships, the EVENT might relate to the organization if there's one, but since there's no explicit organization mentioned beyond Joule (which is a product), there's no relationship to form. The example D had Microsoft Azure as an organization, but here there's none. So no relationships to emit.\n\nMake sure all entity names are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. The EVENT description is concise. No other entities, so the output is just the EVENT.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO JOULE IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-04-03<|>EVENT<|>Enhancements to Joule features; inactive users removed from results; default image applied for oversized uploads)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921249, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 2622, "total_tokens": 3008, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 35.16443472715678, "duration": 10.977}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.

Previously, your confirmation was required before viewing their information.    In the use cases \"View peers\", \"View direct reports\", and \"View manager\", inactive users are now removed from the search result. Previously, they were displayed.      In the \"Create spot award\" use case, if users upload an oversized image for the spot award program, as a workaround, it is automatically replaced by a default image without affecting the award creation. Previously, awards with oversized images couldn’t be successfully created.    \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-04-03\nValid as Of: 2024-04-03\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 119 ---\nComponent: Joule\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: New Use Cases Now Supported in SAP SuccessFactors\nDescription: The following transactional use cases are now supported for SAP SuccessFactors users:    Approve spot award       Create spot award      Clock in clock out      View pay statement      View pay statement (PDF)    \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-02-07\nValid as Of: 2024-02-07\nVersion: Cloud\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ce2733390b79471e65e6f2ac0aab0a195f055ce636e7ad4f1f11cb6a513bfcf9_v2"}
