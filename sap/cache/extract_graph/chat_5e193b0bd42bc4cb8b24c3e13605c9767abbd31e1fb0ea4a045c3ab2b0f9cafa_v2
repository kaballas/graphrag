The user provided a set of instructions for extracting entities and relationships from some SAP release notes. The task is to process the given text and output entities and relationships according to the specified rules.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The text includes several records related to the Pricing Service in Cloud Foundry. Each record has a title and description. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nLooking at the first record: \"functionId}: Allows to process an active uploaded custom pricing routine. Only in non-productive tenants.\" The key here is that it's a new feature in the Pricing Service. Since TECHNOLOGY isn't an allowed entity type, I need to represent this as an EVENT. The title mentions \"functionId\" but the description talks about processing a custom pricing routine. The event name should be something like \"CUSTOM PRICING ROUTINE PROCESSING — 2024-07-24\" using the Valid as Of date. The description would mention processing active uploaded routines, limited to non-productive tenants.\n\nNext, the second record: \"Overwriting the Used Exchange Rate\". The description explains that passing KOMP-KURSK allows overwriting the exchange rate. This is a new feature, so another EVENT entity. The name could be \"OVERWRITING USED EXCHANGE RATE — 2024-07-24\" with a description about using the pricing attribute to change the exchange rate.\n\nThird record: \"Standard Requirement Formula 61\". The description mentions support for formula 61 checking pricing indicators. This is a new feature, so another EVENT. The name would be \"STANDARD REQUIREMENT FORMULA 61 SUPPORT — 2024-07-24\" with the description about checking the pricing indicator and item type.\n\nFourth record: \"Stateless Pricing – Return Condition Scales\". The description talks about returning scale values via an API parameter. This is a new feature, so EVENT entity. The name could be \"STATELESS PRICING SCALE VALUES RETURN — 2024-07-24\" with the description about retrieving scale values for pricing calculations.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The events are related to the Pricing Service component, which is part of the Cloud Foundry environment. However, the allowed entity types don't include technology or products, so I can't create entities for Pricing Service or Cloud Foundry. Therefore, there are no relationships to emit since the relationships would involve these entities which are not allowed.\n\nEach event is standalone, and no other entities (organization, person, geo) are mentioned. So the output will have four EVENT entities and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM PRICING ROUTINE PROCESSING — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Process active uploaded custom pricing routines in non-productive tenants only)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>OVERWRITING USED EXCHANGE RATE — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Use pricing attribute KOMP-KURSK to override item exchange rates during currency conversion)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>STANDARD REQUIREMENT FORMULA 61 SUPPORT — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Support formula 61 checking pricing indicator (KOMP-PRSFD) equals X/B and non-statistical items)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>STATELESS PRICING SCALE VALUES RETURN — 2024-07-24<|>EVENT<|>Retrieve condition scale values via $select=items-conditions-scale in stateless pricing API)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925287, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 777, "prompt_tokens": 3207, "total_tokens": 3984, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.195243225325264, "duration": 24.134}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

The Pricing service determines the right scale value, uses it in price calculation and returns the corresponding price, discount, or surcharge. For example, lower prices are used for higher item quantities.  With the new $select request parameter value items-conditions-scale, it will also be possible for endpoint POST /statelesspricing to get all scale values returned. With that, the calling application could, for example, tell the user: if by buy a certain higher quantity, you will get a certain better price.
