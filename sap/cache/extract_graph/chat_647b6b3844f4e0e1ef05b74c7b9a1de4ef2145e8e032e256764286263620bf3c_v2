The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The instructions say to create EVENT entities for releases, upgrades, etc. \n\nLooking at Record 3738: The title is \"Custom Quota and License Calculation\" with a description mentioning changes starting January 2024. The valid as of date is 2023-12-14. So the event name should be something like \"CUSTOM QUOTA AND LICENSE CALCULATION — 2023-12-14\" with a description about the changes in quota and license calculation.\n\nNext, Record 3739: Title is \"Features and improvements\" under Multitarget Applications. The description talks about improved deployment and specifying HTTP protocol versions. The valid as of date is 2023-12-14. The event name could be \"FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS FOR CLOUD FOUNDRY MTA — 2023-12-14\" with a description about HTTP protocol support.\n\nRecord 3740: Title is \"New SAP HANA Cloud Service Database Event\" with a description about the HDB Transaction Deadlock event. Valid as of 2023-12-14. Event name: \"NEW SAP HANA CLOUD SERVICE DATABASE EVENT — 2023-12-14\" and description about the new event support.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. The environments are Cloud Foundry, SAP Alert Notification Service, etc. But according to the rules, only explicitly mentioned organizations like SAP BTP, Microsoft Azure, etc., should be included. Here, \"Cloud Foundry\" is an environment, not an organization. SAP Alert Notification Service is a component, not an organization. So maybe no organizations here. \n\nGEOs: There's no mention of specific locations, so no GEO entities. \n\nPersons: No named individuals mentioned, so no PERSON entities. \n\nRelationships: The events might be related to Cloud Foundry as the environment, but since Cloud Foundry isn't an organization (it's a platform), and the rules say not to emit products/services as entities unless they are organizations. So no relationships here. \n\nSo the output will have three EVENT entities and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM QUOTA AND LICENSE CALCULATION — 2023-12-14<|>EVENT<|>Changes to custom domain quota and license calculation effective January 2024>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS FOR CLOUD FOUNDRY MTA — 2023-12-14<|>EVENT<|>Improved MTA deployment with HTTP protocol version specification for routes>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW SAP HANA CLOUD SERVICE DATABASE EVENT — 2023-12-14<|>EVENT<|>Support for HDB Transaction Deadlock event in SAP Alert Notification Service>)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926074, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 670, "prompt_tokens": 3075, "total_tokens": 3745, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.575474810311512, "duration": 21.219}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
