The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events or other entities.\n\nStarting with Record 3771: The title is \"Template API\" and the description mentions a change in downloading documents due to malware scanning. Since this is a change in functionality, it's an EVENT. The entity name would be \"TEMPLATE API CHANGE — 2023-12-11\" with a description about not being able to download unscanned documents.\n\nNext, Record 3772: Title is about enabling customer-managed keys. This is a new feature, so another EVENT. The entity name would be \"ENABLE CUSTOMER-MANAGED KEYS — 2023-12-10\" with a description about customers managing their own keys in Cloud Foundry.\n\nRecord 3773 and 3774 are duplicates about SAPUI5 version 1.117.5. Both are in ABAP Environment. Since they're the same, I'll create one EVENT for \"REFERENCED SAPUI5 VERSION — 2023-12-09\" with the description about using SAPUI5 version 1.117.5 in ABAP systems.\n\nRecord 3775: Talks about additional inbound IP addresses in EU10 region. This is a new feature, so EVENT \"ADDITIONAL INBOUND IP ADDRESSES — 2023-12-08\" with the description about EU10 region IPs needing to be added to allowlists.\n\nRecord 3776: New component versions for SAP HANA Cloud. EVENT \"NEW HANA CLOUD COMPONENT VERSIONS — 2023-12-07\" with the description about upgrading to new versions.\n\nRecord 3777: Regular upgrade for Identity Authentication. EVENT \"IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION UPGRADE — 2023-12-06\" with the description about the upgrade.\n\nRecord 3778: Automatic regeneration of outbound certificates. EVENT \"AUTOMATIC CERTIFICATE REGENERATION — 2023-12-06\" with the description about automatic renewal within 14 days.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. For example, the EVENT in 3772 involves Cloud Foundry as the environment, so a relationship between the event and Cloud Foundry (ORGANIZATION). Similarly, the IP addresses in 3775 relate to the EU10 region (GEO). The SAPUI5 version in 3773 is part of ABAP Environment, which is an ORGANIZATION.\n\nI need to ensure all entity types are correct: ORGANIZATION, PERSON, GEO, EVENT. Since none of the records mention people or specific places beyond the EU10 region, those are the only GEO. Cloud Foundry, ABAP Environment, SAP HANA Cloud, etc., are ORGANIZATIONS. Each EVENT is linked to its respective ORGANIZATION or GEO where applicable.\n\nI'll format each entity and relationship as per the examples, making sure the names are uppercase, descriptions are concise, and relationships are correctly linked with appropriate strengths.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPLATE API CHANGE — 2023-12-11<|>EVENT<|>Download restriction: only malware-scanned documents can be exported from template packages)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENABLE CUSTOMER-MANAGED KEYS — 2023-12-10<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Foundry allows customers to manage their own encryption keys via SAP Key Management Service)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REFERENCED SAPUI5 VERSION — 2023-12-09<|>EVENT<|>ABAP systems use SAPUI5 1.117.5 for Fiori launchpad and apps in hotfix collection 5)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ADDITIONAL INBOUND IP ADDRESSES — 2023-12-08<|>EVENT<|>EU10 region allows new IP addresses for SAP Digital Payments Add-On communication)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW HANA CLOUD COMPONENT VERSIONS — 2023-12-07<|>EVENT<|>SAP HANA Cloud updates to 2023.40 (database) and 2023.4.3626 (data lake))  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION UPGRADE — 2023-12-06<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services upgraded authentication infrastructure)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOMATIC CERTIFICATE REGENERATION — 2023-12-06<|>EVENT<|>Outbound certificates auto-regenerate 14 days before expiration for Cloud Identity Services tenants)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ENABLE CUSTOMER-MANAGED KEYS — 2023-12-10<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>Event occurs in this cloud environment<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ADDITIONAL INBOUND IP ADDRESSES — 2023-12-08<|>EU10<|>Event occurs in this geographic region<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>REFERENCED SAPUI5 VERSION — 2023-12-09<|>ABAP ENVIRONMENT<|>Event involves this software environment<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW HANA CLOUD COMPONENT VERSIONS — 2023-12-07<|>SAP HANA CLOUD<|>Event involves this cloud database service<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION UPGRADE — 2023-12-06<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>Event involves this identity management service<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOMATIC CERTIFICATE REGENERATION — 2023-12-06<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES<|>Event involves this identity management service<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923150, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1373, "prompt_tokens": 3963, "total_tokens": 5336, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.78884271863208, "duration": 41.874}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
