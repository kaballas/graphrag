The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the text. There are two records here. Let's start with Record 3379. The title is \"Integrating SAP S/4HANA with Google Workspace Using SAP Document Management Service.\" The description mentions establishing a trust configuration between SAP S/4HANA On-Premise and SAP BTP, and using the Secure File Share Configuration app.\n\nFor entities, I need to check if any of the mentioned items fit the types. \"SAP S/4HANA\" and \"SAP BTP\" are products, but since the entity types don't include technology, they shouldn't be emitted as entities. However, \"Google Workspace\" is a service provided by Google, so that's an organization. The title mentions \"SAP Document Management Service,\" but again, that's a product, not an organization. \n\nNext, the event. The lifecycle here is General Availability, and the valid as of date is 2024-02-23. So the event name would be something like \"INTEGRATING SAP S/4HANA WITH GOOGLE WORKSPACE — 2024-02-23\". The description should mention the trust configuration and the Secure File Share Configuration app.\n\nThen, for relationships, the event involves Google Workspace as the organization. So the relationship would be the event involving Google Workspace's infrastructure. The strength might be around 8 or 9.\n\nNow, Record 3380: Title is \"UI Improvements: Pagination.\" The description talks about a change in the UI to use a More option for pagination. Since this is a change in the UI, it's an event. The valid as of date is the same. The event name would be \"UI IMPROVEMENTS: PAGINATION — 2024-02-23\". The description would note the change from a toggle switch to a More option loading 100 documents at a time.\n\nNo organizations or geos are mentioned here, so no relationships for this event. \n\nI need to make sure all entities are in uppercase and the descriptions are under 25 words. Also, check that no products are mistakenly included as organizations. \n\nSo the final output should have two events and one relationship from the first record. Let me structure that properly.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATING SAP S/4HANA WITH GOOGLE WORKSPACE — 2024-02-23<|>EVENT<|>Establish trust between SAP S/4HANA On-Premise and SAP BTP; configure Secure File Shares for Google Workspace integration)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE WORKSPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud collaboration platform integrated with SAP Document Management Service)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>UI IMPROVEMENTS: PAGINATION — 2024-02-23<|>EVENT<|>Document Management Service now uses More option for pagination instead of toggle switch, loading 100 documents at a time)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEGRATING SAP S/4HANA WITH GOOGLE WORKSPACE — 2024-02-23<|>GOOGLE WORKSPACE<|>Event involves integration with this organization's infrastructure<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923238, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 737, "prompt_tokens": 3028, "total_tokens": 3765, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.643123953458417, "duration": 23.291}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
