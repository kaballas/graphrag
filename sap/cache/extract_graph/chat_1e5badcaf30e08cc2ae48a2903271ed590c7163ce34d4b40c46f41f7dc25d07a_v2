The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, looking at the text, there are three records. Let's go through each one.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Custom Resource Definition. We have also fixed a bug causing out-of-memory errors during the creation of large Functions and prevented caching of arbitrary Secrets & ConfigMaps to avoid controller crashes. In addition, trace span names are now preserved for the same Function's generations to ensure easy observability.\" \n\nThis seems to be about technical fixes and new features. The key here is that there's no mention of specific organizations, people, or geographical locations. The main event here is the release of these fixes and features. The valid as of date is 2024-01-31. So, I should create an EVENT entity for this. The name would be something like \"CUSTOM RESOURCE DEFINITION FIXES — 2024-01-31\" with a description about the bug fixes and improvements.\n\nNext, Record 3569: \"Admin UI design changes\" under Mobile Services in Cloud Foundry. The description mentions changes to the UI to be consistent with SAP BTP, color refresh for dark/light modes. The valid as of date is 2024-01-31. Here, \"Admin UI design changes\" is an event. Also, SAP BTP is an organization. So, the event would be \"ADMIN UI DESIGN CHANGES — 2024-01-31\" and SAP BTP as an organization. The relationship would be that the event involves SAP BTP's UI.\n\nRecord 3570: \"Delete extension bundles from subscribers\" in Mobile Services. This allows deletion from both subscriber and provider accounts. The event here is the new feature, so \"DELETE EXTENSION BUNDLES FROM SUBSCRIBERS — 2024-01-31\". No organizations or geos mentioned here, so just the event.\n\nNow, checking for entities. The first event is about Custom Resource Definition fixes. The second event is Admin UI changes, which relates to SAP BTP (organization). The third is the deletion feature. \n\nFor relationships, the Admin UI event is connected to SAP BTP as the organization involved. The other events don't mention any organizations or geos, so no relationships there. \n\nI need to make sure all entity names are uppercase, types are correct, and descriptions are under 25 words. Also, check that no products are emitted as entities unless they're part of an event. Since the entity types don't include technology, any tech terms are part of the event descriptions. \n\nSo, the final output should list the three events and the SAP BTP organization, with the relationship between the Admin UI event and SAP BTP.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOM RESOURCE DEFINITION FIXES — 2024-01-31<|>EVENT<|>Bug fixes for out-of-memory errors in large Functions; prevention of arbitrary Secret/ConfigMap caching; trace span name preservation for observability)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ADMIN UI DESIGN CHANGES — 2024-01-31<|>EVENT<|>Mobile Services cockpit UI updated for SAP BTP consistency; dark/light mode color refresh)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DELETE EXTENSION BUNDLES FROM SUBSCRIBERS — 2024-01-31<|>EVENT<|>Extension bundle deletion enabled for subscriber and provider accounts in Mobile Services)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing user interface standards for Mobile Services)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ADMIN UI DESIGN CHANGES — 2024-01-31<|>SAP BTP<|>Event aligns with organization's UI standards<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926468, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 850, "prompt_tokens": 3012, "total_tokens": 3862, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.60556257901391, "duration": 26.894}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
