The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. I need to go through the provided records again and make sure I'm capturing all the entities and relationships that fit the specified types: organization, person, geo, event.\n\nStarting with Record 1131 and 1132, which are about new regions on Google Cloud and Azure. The previous extraction included the regions and the cloud providers. But maybe I missed the specific region codes like cf-br30, cf-jp30, etc. However, the user's examples didn't include those codes, so maybe they are not necessary. The GEO entities were already captured as Brazil (São Paulo), Japan (Osaka), etc. So perhaps that's correct.\n\nLooking at Record 1133, which is about the SAP BTP Administrator's Guide. The title is \"Updated Account Model Guidance.\" The previous extraction didn't include this as an event. Since the type is \"Announcement\" and it's a new update, this should be an EVENT. The entity name would be \"UPDATED ACCOUNT MODEL GUIDANCE — 2025-03-31\" with a description about the updated chapter on account models. Also, the component is \"SAP BTP Administrator's Guide,\" which is a product, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity, it should be represented as an EVENT. Wait, the user's instructions say that if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services/environments should be represented as EVENT entities. So \"SAP BTP Administrator's Guide\" is a product, but since it's not in the allowed entity types, it should be part of the EVENT description, not as an entity. So the EVENT entity would be the update itself, not the guide.\n\nRecord 1134 is about SAP Document AI with overall improvements. The previous extraction included this as an EVENT. The description mentions code and stability improvements. That seems correct.\n\nRecord 1135 is about SAP Dynamic Forms Release 2503. The previous extraction included this as an EVENT. The description includes new features like accessing form data, dropdown filtering, etc. That's correct.\n\nRecord 1136 is about Cloud Identity Services regional availability. The previous extraction included the event and the AWS organization and the new data center in Virginia. However, the old data center in Colorado was mentioned but not captured as a GEO. The user's examples didn't include retired locations, so maybe that's not necessary. The IPs listed are technical details and not entities, so they can be omitted.\n\nRecord 1137 is the new Microsoft OneDrive Adapter. The previous extraction included this as an EVENT. Correct.\n\nRecord 1138 is about displaying verifiable credentials. The previous extraction included this as an EVENT. Correct.\n\nNow, looking for missed entities. The user's example D included relationships between the event and the organization and geo. In the previous extraction, for the new regions on Google Cloud and Azure, the relationships were correctly made between the event and the cloud providers (GOOGLE CLOUD, AZURE) and the GEOs. However, in Record 1136, the event \"REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27\" was linked to AWS and the new data center in Virginia. The old data center in Colorado was not included as a GEO, which might be correct since it's retired and not an active location.\n\nAnother possible missed entity is the \"Microsoft OneDrive Adapter\" in Record 1137. The previous extraction included the event but not the adapter as an entity. However, since the adapter is a product/service and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, it should be part of the EVENT description, not an entity. So the EVENT entity is \"NEW MICROSOFT ONEDRIVE ADAPTER — 2025-03-27\" with the description mentioning the adapter's availability.\n\nWait, in the previous extraction, the event was correctly named \"NEW MICROSOFT ONEDRIVE ADAPTER — 2025-03-27\" and the description says \"Microsoft OneDrive adapter now available for Cloud Foundry integration.\" That's correct.\n\nAnother possible missed entity is the \"Decentralized Identity Verification\" component in Record 1138. But since it's a product and not an allowed entity type, it's represented in the EVENT description.\n\nLooking back, the user's examples included events for each record that had a \"Type\" of New, Changed, Announcement, etc. The previous extraction included events for Records 1131, 1132, 1134, 1135, 1136, 1137, 1138. However, Record 1133 was an Announcement but wasn't captured as an event. That's a missed entity.\n\nSo, adding the event for Record 1133: \"UPDATED ACCOUNT MODEL GUIDANCE — 2025-03-31\" with the description about the updated chapter in the SAP BTP Administrator's Guide. Also, the component is \"SAP BTP Administrator's Guide,\" but since it's a product, it's not an entity. So the event is the update itself.\n\nAdditionally, in Record 1136, the event \"REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27\" was linked to AWS and the new data center. The old data center in Colorado was not included as a GEO, which is correct since it's retired.\n\nAnother possible missed relationship is between the event in Record 1136 and the AWS organization, which was already included. Also, the new data center in Virginia is linked to the event.\n\nSo, the main missed entity is the one from Record 1133. Adding that event and ensuring all relationships are covered.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>UPDATED ACCOUNT MODEL GUIDANCE — 2025-03-31<|>EVENT<|>SAP BTP Administrator's Guide updates include multi-runtime account models, templates, and automation tools for setup)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Documentation resource for SAP BTP account model configurations)|  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>UPDATED ACCOUNT MODEL GUIDANCE — 2025-03-31<|>SAP BTP ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE<|>Event updates documentation for this resource<|>8)|  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925332, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1379, "prompt_tokens": 4839, "total_tokens": 6218, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.32384792086634, "duration": 42.662}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

The user provided a bunch of records from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify for entity extraction. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. Let's start with Record 1131. The title is \"New Regions Available\" and the description mentions new regions on Google Cloud: Brazil (São Paulo), Japan (Osaka), Japan (Tokyo), KSA (Dammam). \n\nFor entities, the regions like Brazil (São Paulo) are GEOs. Google Cloud is an ORGANIZATION. The event here is the availability of these new regions, so I'll create an EVENT entity with the name \"NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31\" and a description mentioning the regions and Google Cloud.\n\nNext, Record 1132 talks about new regions on Azure: Canada Central (Toronto), China North 3 (Hebei). Similarly, Azure is an ORGANIZATION, and the regions are GEOs. The EVENT entity here would be \"NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31\" with the respective regions.\n\nRecord 1133 is about an updated account model guidance. Since it's an announcement and doesn't mention specific regions, organizations, or events, there's no entity here. The type is \"Announcement,\" which might not qualify as an event unless it's a new capability. But the description doesn't mention a specific event, so maybe skip this one.\n\nRecord 1134 mentions improvements in SAP Document AI. Since the entity types don't include technology products unless they're part of an event, and the description is about code and stability improvements, this might be an EVENT. The title is \"Overall Improvements,\" so the EVENT entity would be \"OVERALL IMPROVEMENTS — 2025-03-31\" with a description about code and stability.\n\nRecord 1135 is about SAP Dynamic Forms Release 2503. The title is a release, so that's an EVENT. The description includes new features, so the EVENT entity would be \"RELEASE 2503 — 2025-03-28\" with the features listed.\n\nRecord 1136 discusses regional availability for Cloud Identity Services on AWS. The new data center in the US (Virginia) is a GEO, and AWS is an ORGANIZATION. The event is the regional availability, so EVENT entity \"REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27\" with the details. Also, the old data center in Colorado is a GEO, but since it's no longer used, maybe not include it unless specified. The IPs are technical details, not entities.\n\nRecord 1137 introduces a new Microsoft OneDrive Adapter. Since it's a new feature, that's an EVENT. The EVENT entity would be \"NEW MICROSOFT ONEDRIVE ADAPTER — 2025-03-27\" with the description.\n\nRecord 1138 allows displaying verifiable credentials in a form. This is a new feature, so EVENT entity \"DISPLAY VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS — 2025-03-27\" with the description.\n\nNow, relationships. For each EVENT, link to the relevant ORGANIZATION or GEO. For example, the new regions on Google Cloud (EVENT) relates to Google Cloud (ORGANIZATION) and the GEOs. Similarly, the Azure regions relate to Azure and their respective GEOs. The AWS data center relates to AWS (ORGANIZATION) and the GEOs.\n\nI need to make sure all entities are in uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formed with strength between 1-10. Also, check that no invalid entities are included. For example, \"SAP BTP Administrator's Guide\" isn't an entity type allowed, so it's skipped. \n\nDouble-checking each record to ensure compliance with the rules. Avoiding any markdown and following the output format strictly. Finally, list all entities first, then relationships, separated by ##, ending with <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Foundry now supports Brazil (São Paulo), Japan (Osaka), Japan (Tokyo), KSA (Dammam) on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for Cloud Foundry regions)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL (SÃO PAULO)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN (OSAKA)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN (TOKYO)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>KSA (DAMMAM)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Google Cloud)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Foundry now supports Canada Central (Toronto), China North 3 (Hebei) on Azure)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for Cloud Foundry regions)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>CANADA CENTRAL (TORONTO)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Azure)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA NORTH 3 (HEBEI)<|>GEO<|>New Cloud Foundry region available on Azure)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>OVERALL IMPROVEMENTS — 2025-03-31<|>EVENT<|>Code and stability improvements for SAP Document AI in Cloud Foundry)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>RELEASE 2503 — 2025-03-28<|>EVENT<|>SAP Dynamic Forms adds form data access, dropdown filtering, and preprocessing capabilities)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services now uses AWS US (Virginia) DC; US (Colorado) DC retired)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing infrastructure for Cloud Identity Services)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES (VIRGINIA)<|>GEO<|>New data center for Cloud Identity Services on AWS)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW MICROSOFT ONEDRIVE ADAPTER — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>Microsoft OneDrive adapter now available for Cloud Foundry integration)|  \n(\"entity\"<|>DISPLAY VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS — 2025-03-27<|>EVENT<|>Admin dashboard displays verified verifiable credentials and presentations)|  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>BRAZIL (SÃO PAULO)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>JAPAN (OSAKA)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>JAPAN (TOKYO)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>KSA (DAMMAM)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>AZURE<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>CANADA CENTRAL (TORONTO)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW REGIONS AVAILABLE — 2025-03-31<|>CHINA NORTH 3 (HEBEI)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)|  \n(\"relationship\"<|>REGIONAL AVAILABILITY — 2025-03-27<|>UNITED STATES (VIRGINIA)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)|  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
