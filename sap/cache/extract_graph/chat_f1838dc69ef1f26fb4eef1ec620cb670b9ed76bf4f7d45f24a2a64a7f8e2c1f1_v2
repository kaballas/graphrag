The user provided some real data from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the two records provided. Let's start with Record 1939. The title is \"Documentation update only: Administrators in Sub-orgs Can Promote to Parent Orgs\". The description mentions updates to Help Center topics about user roles and promoting tasks from sub-orgs to parent orgs. The valid as of date is 2024-11-14.\n\nAccording to the steps, I need to create EVENT entities for releases, upgrades, etc. The title mentions a documentation update, which is a change, so that's an event. The name should be something like \"DOCUMENTATION UPDATE FOR SUB-ORG PROMOTION — 2024-11-14\". The description would be about the clarification in Help Center topics regarding administrators promoting tasks.\n\nNext, Record 1940: Title is \"OData Adapter Option 'Use Audit' Set to False By Default\". The description says the 'Use Audit' option is now false by default, affecting task errors. Valid as of 2024-11-14. This is another change, so another EVENT entity. The name could be \"ODATA ADAPTER 'USE AUDIT' DEFAULT SET TO FALSE — 2024-11-14\". The description explains the default setting and its effect on task errors.\n\nNow, checking entity types. The EVENT entities are created for each record. The other entity types (organization, person, geo) aren't mentioned here, so no need to add them. The Line of Business is \"Database and Data Management\", but since that's not an allowed entity type (unless it's an organization, which it's not), it's dropped. \n\nNo relationships are mentioned between events and other entities, so no relationships to extract. Both records are about changes in the Cloud Integration for Data Services component, but since the component isn't an allowed entity type (unless it's an organization, which it's not), it's not emitted. \n\nSo the output should have two EVENT entities with their descriptions, no relationships, and end with <|COMPLETE|>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENTATION UPDATE FOR SUB-ORG PROMOTION — 2024-11-14<|>EVENT<|>Help Center clarifies sub-org administrators can promote tasks to parent orgs with appropriate roles>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ODATA ADAPTER 'USE AUDIT' DEFAULT SET TO FALSE — 2024-11-14<|>EVENT<|>OData adapter's 'Use Audit' option defaults to false, affecting task error handling in data flows>)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925535, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 595, "prompt_tokens": 2967, "total_tokens": 3562, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.390134529147986, "duration": 18.955}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
