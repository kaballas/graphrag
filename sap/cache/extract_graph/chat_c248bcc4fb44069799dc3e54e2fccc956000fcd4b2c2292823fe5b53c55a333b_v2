The user provided some real data from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. There are three records here. Let's go through each one.\n\nStarting with Record 2089. The title is \"Transition to SAP Build Process Automation\" under the Workflow Capability component. The description mentions deprecation of instance-secrets and updating the transitioning guide. The lifecycle is General Availability, type Changed, and valid as of 2024-10-18. \n\nAccording to the steps, I need to create EVENT entities for releases, upgrades, etc. The title seems to be an event. The name should be \"TRANSITION TO SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION — 2024-10-18\". The description would mention the deprecation of instance-secrets and the update to the guide. \n\nNext, check if there are any organizations, people, or geos. The environment is Cloud Foundry, but since the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and Cloud Foundry is a product/environment, but the rules say not to emit products/services/environments as entities unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed. Wait, the entity_types given here are organization, person, geo, event. So, TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types. Therefore, Cloud Foundry shouldn't be an entity. But the title mentions SAP Build Process Automation, which is a product. However, the rules state that if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted as entities. So, SAP Build Process Automation would be part of the event description, not an entity. \n\nSo, the only entity here is the event. \n\nNow, Record 2090: Title is \"Security Update\" under Continuous Integration & Delivery. The description talks about improving security with TLS 1.3, impacting customers using Cloud Connector with older Java versions. Valid as of 2024-10-18. \n\nThis is another event. The name would be \"SECURITY UPDATE — 2024-10-18\". The description mentions the TLS 1.3 change and impact on Cloud Connectors. \n\nAgain, checking for entities. The Cloud Connector is part of the description, but since it's a product and TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity type, it shouldn't be emitted. So, only the event entity here. \n\nNow, looking for relationships. The first event (Transition to SAP Build Process Automation) might involve SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION as an organization? Wait, no. The rules say ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned. SAP Build Process Automation is a product, not an organization. So, no organization here. \n\nThe second event (Security Update) mentions Cloud Connector, but again, that's a product. So, no entities to relate. \n\nTherefore, only the two events are emitted, and no relationships. \n\nWait, but the first record's title is \"Transition to SAP Build Process Automation\". The description says the transitioning guide has been updated. Maybe SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION is an organization? But no, it's a product. So, no. \n\nSo, the output should be two event entities and no relationships. Let me check the examples again. In Example D, they had an event related to Microsoft Azure and Sydney, Australia. But here, there's no such connection. \n\nSo, final output: two events, no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSITION TO SAP BUILD PROCESS AUTOMATION — 2024-10-18<|>EVENT<|>Transitioning guide updated due to instance-secrets deprecation; use SAP Build Process Automation for workflow runtime OAuth destinations)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SECURITY UPDATE — 2024-10-18<|>EVENT<|>Backend ingresses now require TLS 1.3; impacts Cloud Connector users with older Java versions or on-premises systems)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926351, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 868, "prompt_tokens": 2970, "total_tokens": 3838, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.963470319634705, "duration": 27.156}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
