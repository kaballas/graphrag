The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided text based on the given entity types: organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, looking at the first part of the text: \"allowing metric collection without mTLS. To disable this feature for a specific workload, you can use the prometheus.istio.io/merge-metrics: 'false' annotation.\" This seems like a technical feature update. Since the entity types don't include technology, I need to represent this as an EVENT. The valid as of date is 2025-03-26, so the event name would be something like \"METRIC COLLECTION WITHOUT MTLS — 2025-03-26\". The description would mention allowing metric collection without mTLS and the annotation to disable it.\n\nNext, Record 1149: SAP Document AI is now available in the Amazon Web Services region br10 - Brazil (São Paulo). Here, the main entities are the event (availability in a new region), Amazon Web Services (organization), and Brazil (São Paulo) as a geographic location. The event name would be \"SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN BR10 — 2025-03-26\". The description would state the availability in the new AWS region. Then, relationships: the event involves Amazon Web Services and occurs in Brazil (São Paulo).\n\nRecord 1150: Prevent Itemization of Merchandise Sets for Promotion Recommendations flag. This is a new feature in SAP Omnichannel Promotion Pricing. Since it's a new feature, it's an EVENT. The event name would be \"PREVENT ITEMIZATION OF MERCHANDISE SETS FLAG — 2025-03-26\". The description would explain the flag's purpose and default setting.\n\nNow, checking entity types. For the first event, no organization or geo, just the event. For the AWS record, Amazon Web Services is an organization, Brazil (São Paulo) is a geo. The third record is another event. \n\nI need to make sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formed. Also, ensure that products/services aren't emitted as entities unless they're part of an organization. \n\nDouble-checking the dates: the valid as of is 2025-03-26 for the first and third records, and the latest revision for the AWS record is 2025-05-15, but the valid as of is 2025-03-26. So the event date should use the valid as of date. \n\nRelationships: The AWS event is linked to Amazon Web Services (organization) and Brazil (São Paulo) (geo). Strengths would be 9 and 10 respectively. \n\nNo person entities mentioned, so none of those. All set.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>METRIC COLLECTION WITHOUT MTLS — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>Allow metric collection without mTLS; disable via prometheus.istio.io/merge-metrics: 'false' annotation)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN BR10 — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>SAP Document AI now available in Amazon Web Services region BR10 - Brazil (São Paulo))  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON WEB SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform hosting SAP Document AI in BR10 region)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL (SÃO PAULO)<|>GEO<|>AWS region BR10 where SAP Document AI is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PREVENT ITEMIZATION OF MERCHANDISE SETS FLAG — 2025-03-26<|>EVENT<|>New flag in Maintain Promotions app to control itemization of merchandise sets for promotions)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN BR10 — 2025-03-26<|>AMAZON WEB SERVICES<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>SAP DOCUMENT AI AVAILABILITY IN BR10 — 2025-03-26<|>BRAZIL (SÃO PAULO)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926683, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 977, "prompt_tokens": 3014, "total_tokens": 3991, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.89787456332234, "duration": 30.629}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
