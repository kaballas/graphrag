The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events or other entities.\n\nStarting with Record 2591: \"Cloud Identity Services have been upgraded.\" This sounds like an event. The title is \"Regular Upgrade,\" and the valid date is 2024-07-17. So, the event name would be \"CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES UPGRADE — 2024-07-17\" with a description about the upgrade. Since the component is Cloud Identity Services, but the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Cloud Identity Services is a product, not an organization, so it's not an entity. But the event is valid.\n\nRecord 2592: Title is \"SAP Advanced Financial Closing - group mapping.\" The description talks about extending transformations. This seems like a change, so an event. The event name would be \"SAP ADVANCED FINANCIAL CLOSING GROUP MAPPING — 2024-07-17\" with the description about the extended transformations.\n\nRecord 2593: \"Support for OAuth certificate authentication\" under Identity Provisioning. This is a new feature, so an event. The event name would be \"OAUTH CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION SUPPORT — 2024-07-17\" with the description about supporting OAuth for specific systems.\n\nRecord 2594: \"User Management\" change where meta.lastModified isn't updated after sign-in. This is an announcement, so an event. The event name would be \"USER MANAGEMENT METADATA CHANGE — 2024-07-17\" with the description about the attribute no longer being modified.\n\nRecord 2595: \"Procurement Data Warehouse connector\" added as a new feature. Event name: \"PROCUREMENT DATA WAREHOUSE CONNECTOR — 2024-07-17\" with the description about configuring it as source, target, proxy.\n\nRecord 2596: Deprecation of SAP Business Ecology Management bundle. This is a change event. Event name: \"SAP BUSINESS ECOLOGY MANAGEMENT DEPRECATION — 2024-07-17\" with the description about discontinuing the bundle.\n\nRecord 2597: Same as 2593, but under Identity Provisioning. But since the title is the same, maybe it's a duplicate? Wait, the component is different (Identity Provisioning vs. Cloud Identity Services?), but the description is similar. However, the user might want each record treated separately. But the event name would be similar, but maybe the component is part of the description. However, the rules say to use the text as is. So, perhaps it's another event, but the title is the same. However, the user might consider it a separate event. But the description is the same, so maybe it's a duplicate. But the records are separate, so I'll create the event again.\n\nRecord 2598: Istio module update to 1.22.2. This is a change, so an event. Event name: \"ISTIO MODULE UPDATE TO 1.22.2 — 2024-07-17\" with the description about the update and references to release notes.\n\nRecord 2599: Telemetry module update to 1.19.0. Another change event. Event name: \"TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE TO 1.19.0 — 2024-07-17\" with the description about improvements in logs, metrics, traces.\n\nRecord 2600: Incomplete, so skip.\n\nNow, check for entities. The only entities allowed are organization, person, geo, event. The events are the main entities here. The components like Cloud Identity Services, Identity Provisioning, Kyma Runtime are products, not organizations, so they aren't entities. The environments like Cloud Foundry, Kyma, Neo are part of the environment field but not entities unless they are organizations. For example, Kyma is a product, not an organization. So, no organizations here except maybe SAP, but it's not mentioned. The only entities are the events.\n\nSo, each record that's a change, upgrade, new feature, etc., becomes an event. Then, relationships: the examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. But in these records, there's no mention of organizations or geos. So, no relationships to emit. Therefore, the output will be the list of events without relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD IDENTITY SERVICES UPGRADE — 2024-07-17<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services have been upgraded across Cloud Foundry, Kyma, and Neo environments>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP ADVANCED FINANCIAL CLOSING GROUP MAPPING — 2024-07-17<|>EVENT<|>Extended group mapping transformations for SAP Advanced Financial Closing provisioning systems>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OAUTH CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION SUPPORT — 2024-07-17<|>EVENT<|>Identity Provisioning now supports OAuth certificate authentication for Procurement Data Warehouse and SAP Business Network>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER MANAGEMENT METADATA CHANGE — 2024-07-17<|>EVENT<|>meta.lastModified attribute no longer updates after user sign-in in Identity Provisioning>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCUREMENT DATA WAREHOUSE CONNECTOR — 2024-07-17<|>EVENT<|>Identity Provisioning supports Procurement Data Warehouse as source, target, and proxy system>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BUSINESS ECOLOGY MANAGEMENT DEPRECATION — 2024-07-17<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Identity Services no longer bundled with SAP Business Ecology Management>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISTIO MODULE UPDATE TO 1.22.2 — 2024-07-17<|>EVENT<|>Kyma Runtime updated to Istio 1.22.2 with release notes and upgrade guidance>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TELEMETRY MODULE UPDATE TO 1.19.0 — 2024-07-17<|>EVENT<|>Kyma Runtime telemetry module updated to 1.19.0 with TLS certificate validation and resource optimization>)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925426, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1426, "prompt_tokens": 3965, "total_tokens": 5391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.362716635875778, "duration": 45.468}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
