The user provided a text about Joule being migrated to SAP Identity Authentication (IAS) and the changes in trust configurations. The task is to extract entities and relationships based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the entities. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nLooking at the text, \"SAP Identity Authentication (IAS)\" is mentioned. Since IAS is a service provided by SAP, which is an organization, but the rules say to emit ORGANIZATION only if explicitly mentioned. However, the note says not to emit products/services as entities unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed. Wait, the user's Entity_types here include organization, so maybe IAS is considered an organization? Wait, the instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" But in this case, the Entity_types include organization, so maybe IAS is considered an organization. But I need to check if the user's Entity_types include TECHNOLOGY. Wait, the user's Entity_types in the real data are organization, person, geo, event. So TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types. Therefore, products like IAS should not be emitted as entities but represented as events. Wait, but the instruction says: \"When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\" So since the user's Entity_types don't include TECHNOLOGY, products like IAS should not be emitted as entities. Therefore, IAS is a product/service, so it's not an entity. So I need to check if there are any organizations mentioned. The text mentions \"SAP Identity Authentication (IAS)\" but that's a product. The organization would be SAP, but the text doesn't explicitly mention SAP as an organization. Wait, the text says \"SAP Identity Authentication (IAS)\" but the user's allowed entity types include organization. However, the instruction says not to emit products/services unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed. Since the user's Entity_types don't include TECHNOLOGY, IAS is a product and shouldn't be an entity. So maybe there are no organizations here. \n\nNext, looking for events. The text describes a migration to IAS, changes in trust configurations, and a required action. These are changes that qualify as events. The valid as of date is 2024-04-16. So the event name would be something like \"JOULE MIGRATION TO SAP IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION — 2024-04-16\". The description would mention the migration, the requirement for OpenID Connect, and the deprecation of SAML. \n\nAre there any GEOs or PERSONs? The text doesn't mention any specific locations or people, so those can be ignored. \n\nNow, relationships. The event involves the migration to IAS, which is a product, but since IAS isn't an entity (as per the rules), there's no organization to link. However, if SAP is considered an organization, but the text doesn't explicitly mention SAP as an organization. The text only mentions \"SAP Identity Authentication (IAS)\" as the product. Since we can't emit products as entities, there's no organization here. Therefore, no relationships can be formed. \n\nSo the output would be the event entity and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE MIGRATION TO SAP IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION — 2024-04-16<|>EVENT<|>Joule now uses SAP Identity Authentication (IAS) with OpenID Connect; SAML-trusted IdPs deprecated after transition period)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926378, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 788, "prompt_tokens": 2865, "total_tokens": 3653, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.246282564732937, "duration": 25.219}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.

Joule now requires a trust configuration of type OpenID Connect with your Identity Authentication tenant. SAML-trusted IdPs for Joule will be supported for a short period after which the trust configuration of type OpenID Connect will be required.  If you are using SAML-trusted IdPs for Joule, you need to change the SAML trust configuration to an OIDC configuration. For more information, see Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect Trust with Identity Authentication.   Ensure that you have configured the trusted domains in Identity Authentication as described in Configure Trusted Domains in Identity Authentication.Note  No action is needed if you are using OIDC trust set up for Joule.\nAction: Required\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-04-16\nValid as Of: 2024-04-16\nVersion: Cloud\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e0e5d96214aa5cf74e566395e7a1deb65a8ef193221e479e21e623f2299fab35_v2"}
