The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and see if they qualify for an EVENT entity. The instructions say that whenever there's a release, upgrade, fix, etc., we should create an EVENT. Each record here seems to be a new feature or enhancement in the ABAP Environment, so each should be an EVENT.\n\nLooking at the first record: \"Improved CDS Buffering - Buffer Delegation\". The valid as of date is 2025-05-16. The event name should be \"IMPROVED CDS BUFFERING — 2025-05-16\". The description would mention optimizing ABAP memory with delegated buffers.\n\nNext, \"Include Start Authorizations...\" – same date. Event name: \"INCLUDE START AUTHORIZATIONS... — 2025-05-16\". Description about provider support roles including start authorizations.\n\nThird record: \"Including Custom Authorizations...\" – same date. Event name: \"INCLUDING CUSTOM AUTHORIZATIONS... — 2025-05-16\". Description about extending development test roles with custom authorizations.\n\nFourth: \"Increased SAP HANA Cloud Backup Retention...\" – event name \"INCREASED SAP HANA CLOUD BACKUP... — 2025-05-16\". Description about backup retention time increased to 30 days.\n\nFifth: \"Message Monitoring for Integration Experts\" – event name \"MESSAGE MONITORING FOR INTEGRATION EXPERTS — 2025-05-16\". Description about downloading original payload.\n\nSixth: \"New Email Configuration...\" – event name \"NEW EMAIL CONFIGURATION... — 2025-05-16\". Description about new email entities in the app.\n\nSeventh: \"New Skip Function...\" – event name \"NEW SKIP FUNCTION... — 2025-05-16\". Description about skipping job executions.\n\nEighth: \"Null Value Handling\" – event name \"NULL VALUE HANDLING — 2025-05-16\". Description about differences in null values in OData.\n\nNinth: \"OData UI Service from Scratch\" – event name \"ODATA UI SERVICE FROM SCRATCH — 2025-05-16\". Description about creating RAP-service objects.\n\nTenth: \"Referenced SAPUI5 Version\" – but the description is cut off. However, since it's a new feature, I'll still create an event with the available info.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The entities are all EVENTS, and the other types (organization, person, geo) aren't mentioned here. So no relationships to emit. Each event is standalone. \n\nI need to make sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and formatted correctly. Also, check that no other entity types are included. Since the records don't mention organizations, people, or geos, only the events are valid. \n\nSo the output will be each event entity, followed by no relationships. Each event is a separate entry with the specified format.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>IMPROVED CDS BUFFERING — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>Optimize ABAP memory consumption via delegated buffers for CDS view entity-level buffering)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INCLUDE START AUTHORIZATIONS FOR CUSTOM SERVICES — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>Provider support roles now include start authorizations for custom services in add-ons)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INCLUDING CUSTOM AUTHORIZATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT TEST ROLE — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>Development test roles now include full authorizations for custom objects in default values)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INCREASED SAP HANA CLOUD BACKUP RETENTION TIME — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>SAP HANA Cloud backups retained for 30 days instead of 14 days in ABAP environments)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>MESSAGE MONITORING FOR INTEGRATION EXPERTS — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>Download original message payloads via Message Monitoring for Integration Experts)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW EMAIL CONFIGURATION FOR UPLOAD BUSINESS CONFIGURATION — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>New email entities (SMAIL_VM_DF_ADDR, SMAIL_VM_RCV_DOM, SMAIL_VM_SND_DOM) added to configuration)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW SKIP FUNCTION IN APPLICATION JOB TEMPLATES — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>Skip single periodic job chain executions in Application Job Templates app)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NULL VALUE HANDLING — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>Clarify null vs. initial value behavior in OData V2/V4 for sorting/filtering)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ODATA UI SERVICE FROM SCRATCH — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>Create RAP-service repository objects via OData UI Service from Scratch wizard)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>REFERENCED SAPUI5 VERSION — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>SAPUI5 version 1.133.2 used for administrator Fiori launchpad in hotfix collection 3)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925856, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1227, "prompt_tokens": 3961, "total_tokens": 5188, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.416580803677576, "duration": 37.851}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
