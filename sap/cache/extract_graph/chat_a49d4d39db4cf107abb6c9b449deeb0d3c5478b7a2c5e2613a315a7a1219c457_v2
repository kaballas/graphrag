The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify the events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. Since the records mention Joule and various data centers, I should look for events related to new features, availability in data centers, etc.\n\nStarting with Record 111: The title is \"Joule Booster\" and the description talks about selecting SAP SuccessFactors system in the integration screen. This seems like a change, so I'll create an EVENT entity. The name would be \"JOULE BOOSTER — 2024-07-11\" with a description about the integration change.\n\nRecord 112: \"New Document Grounding Capability\" in SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite. This is a new feature, so another EVENT entity: \"NEW DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY — 2024-06-24\" with the description about adding context via documents.\n\nRecord 113: New use cases in SAP SuccessFactors. The title is \"New Use Cases Now Supported in SAP SuccessFactors\". The event name would be \"NEW USE CASES SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-06-21\" and the description lists the use cases.\n\nRecord 114: New conversational patterns and use cases. Title is \"New Conversational Pattern and Use Cases Now Supported in SAP SuccessFactors\". Event name: \"NEW CONVERSATIONAL PATTERNS AND USE CASES — 2024-05-17\" with the description mentioning 25 new transactional cases and 40 navigational use cases.\n\nRecord 115: Migration to IAS based multitenancy. This is a change, so EVENT: \"JOULE MIGRATION TO IAS MULTITENANCY — 2024-04-16\" with the description about using OpenID Connect and SAML trust changes.\n\nRecord 116: Data Center Availability in Europe (Frankfurt) EU access only data center of AWS. This is a new availability, so EVENT: \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EUROPE (EU) — 2024-04-12\" and ORGANIZATION: \"AWS\" with GEO: \"FRANKFURT, EUROPE (EU)\".\n\nRecord 117: Data Center Availability in Australia (Sydney) data center of AWS. Similar to 116, EVENT: \"JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — 2024-04-11\", ORGANIZATION: \"AWS\", GEO: \"SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA\".\n\nRecord 118: Enhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors. The event name would be \"ENHANCEMENTS TO JOULE IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-04-03\" with the description about displaying info directly and removing inactive users.\n\nNow, relationships. For each event related to AWS data centers, link the event to AWS (ORGANIZATION) and the respective GEO. For example, the Frankfurt event is linked to AWS and FRANKFURT, EUROPE (EU). Same for Sydney and AWS. The migration event (Record 115) involves SAP IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION (IAS) as an organization, so a relationship between the event and IAS.\n\nI need to ensure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formed with strength between 1-10. Also, check that no invalid entities are included. Products like SAP SuccessFactors are not entities here since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, so they are part of the event descriptions.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE BOOSTER — 2024-07-11<|>EVENT<|>Joule booster now allows selecting SAP SuccessFactors system via registered systems in SAP BTP instead of manual URL entry)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY — 2024-06-24<|>EVENT<|>Document grounding capability added to SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite for contextual data in Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES SUPPORTED IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-06-21<|>EVENT<|>22 transactional and 1 navigational use cases added for SAP SuccessFactors users in Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CONVERSATIONAL PATTERNS AND USE CASES — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>25 new transactional cases and 40 navigational use cases added to Joule for SAP SuccessFactors)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE MIGRATION TO IAS MULTITENANCY — 2024-04-16<|>EVENT<|>Joule now uses SAP Identity Authentication (IAS) multitenancy with OpenID Connect trust configuration)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EUROPE (EU) — 2024-04-12<|>EVENT<|>Joule now available in AWS Frankfurt, Europe (EU) data center with EU access only)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing data center infrastructure for Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKFURT, EUROPE (EU)<|>GEO<|>Data center location for AWS where Joule is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — 2024-04-11<|>EVENT<|>Joule now available in AWS Sydney, Australia data center)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Data center location for AWS where Joule is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO JOULE IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-04-03<|>EVENT<|>Single name match displays directly; inactive users removed from \"View peers\" and similar use cases)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EUROPE (EU) — 2024-04-12<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EUROPE (EU) — 2024-04-12<|>FRANKFURT, EUROPE (EU)<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — 2024-04-11<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — 2024-04-11<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE MIGRATION TO IAS MULTITENANCY — 2024-04-16<|>SAP IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION<|>Event involves organization's authentication service<|>8)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926919, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1670, "prompt_tokens": 3920, "total_tokens": 5590, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.336140962339044, "duration": 51.645}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

SAML-trusted IdPs for Joule will be supported for a short period after which the trust configuration of type OpenID Connect will be required.  If you are using SAML-trusted IdPs for Joule, you need to change the SAML trust configuration to an OIDC configuration. For more information, see Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect Trust with Identity Authentication.
