The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP release notes based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to go through each record and identify events, organizations, geos, and people.\n\nStarting with Record 111: The title is \"Joule Booster\" and the description mentions selecting SAP SuccessFactors system in the integration screen. Since Joule is a technology component, but the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. The main event here is the enhancement to Joule Booster, so I'll create an EVENT entity with the title and valid date. No organizations or geos mentioned here except maybe SAP SuccessFactors, but according to the rules, products/services aren't entities unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed. Wait, the entity types include organization, so SAP BTP might be an organization. But the text doesn't mention SAP BTP explicitly here. Hmm, maybe not. So just the event.\n\nRecord 112: New Document Grounding Capability. The description says it's available in SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite. Again, the event is the new capability. No organizations mentioned except maybe SAP, but the rules say not to emit products unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed. Wait, the entity types here are organization, person, geo, event. So SAP SuccessFactors is a product, not an organization. So just the event.\n\nRecord 113: New Use Cases Supported. The event is the new use cases. No organizations or geos here.\n\nRecord 114: New Conversational Patterns and Use Cases. Another event. Same as above.\n\nRecord 115: Migration to IAS Multitenancy. The event is the migration. The description mentions SAP Identity Authentication (IAS) and OpenID Connect. IAS is a service, but the entity types don't include technology, so maybe not. However, the note says if using SAML, need to change to OIDC. But no organizations here. So just the event.\n\nRecord 116: Data Center Availability in Europe (Frankfurt) EU access only data center of AWS. Here, AWS is an organization, and Frankfurt, EU is a geo. The event is Joule's availability in that data center. So create EVENT for the availability, then AWS as organization, and Frankfurt, EU as geo. Relationship between event and AWS (organization), and event and geo.\n\nRecord 117: Data Center Availability in Australia (Sydney) data center of AWS. Similar to 116. Event, AWS, Sydney, Australia. Relationships.\n\nRecord 118: Enhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors. The event is the enhancements. The description mentions inactive users removed from certain views. So the event entity here.\n\nNow, check each entity against the rules. Ensure that only allowed types are included. For example, in 116 and 117, AWS is an organization, and the geos are Frankfurt, EU and Sydney, Australia. The events are named with the date from Valid as Of.\n\nFor relationships, in 116 and 117, the event is related to AWS (organization) and the geo. So relationships would be event to AWS (involves organization's infrastructure) and event to geo (occurs in location). Strengths around 9 or 10.\n\nMake sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are under 20 words. Also, check for any other entities that might have been missed. For example, in Record 115, there's mention of OpenID Connect and SAML, but those are protocols, not entities. So no entities there.\n\nNow, compiling all the entities and relationships as per the examples.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE BOOSTER ENHANCEMENT — 2024-07-11<|>EVENT<|>Joule Booster now allows selecting SAP SuccessFactors system via integration screen instead of manual URL entry)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY — 2024-06-24<|>EVENT<|>Document grounding now available in SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite for adding context to Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-06-21<|>EVENT<|>25+ new transactional and navigational use cases added for SAP SuccessFactors users)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CONVERSATIONAL PATTERNS — 2024-05-17<|>EVENT<|>25 new transactional cases and 40 navigational use cases added to Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE MIGRATION TO IAS — 2024-04-16<|>EVENT<|>Joule now uses SAP Identity Authentication (IAS) multitenancy with OpenID Connect trust)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EU DATA CENTER — 2024-04-12<|>EVENT<|>Joule now available in AWS Frankfurt, EU data center for EU access only)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud computing platform providing data center infrastructure for Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKFURT, EU<|>GEO<|>Data center location for AWS where Joule is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — 2024-04-11<|>EVENT<|>Joule now available in AWS Sydney, Australia data center)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Data center location for AWS where Joule is now available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENTS TO JOULE IN SAP SUCCESSFACTORS — 2024-04-03<|>EVENT<|>Inactive users removed from views; oversized images fixed in \"Create spot award\")  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EU DATA CENTER — 2024-04-12<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN FRANKFURT, EU DATA CENTER — 2024-04-12<|>FRANKFURT, EU<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — 2024-04-11<|>AWS<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>JOULE AVAILABILITY IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — 2024-04-11<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>Event occurs in this geographic location<|>10)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921279, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1541, "prompt_tokens": 3552, "total_tokens": 5093, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 35.94588290179613, "duration": 42.87}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
