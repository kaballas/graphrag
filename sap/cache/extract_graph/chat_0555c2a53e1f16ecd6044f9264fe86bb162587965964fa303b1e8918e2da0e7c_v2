The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the records are about changes or new features in SAP components, they should be events. \n\nLooking at Record 1501: The title mentions a change in the Configurations API. The valid as of date is 2025-02-05. So, the event name would be \"PRODUCTION - CONFIGURATIONS API – RAISE CONFLICT FOR NON-UNIQUE INFERENCE...\" with the date. The description should summarize the change.\n\nSimilarly, Records 1502, 1503, 1504 all have \"Changed\" type and valid dates. Each of these will be separate events. Record 1505 is a \"New\" feature, so that's another event. Records 1506, 1507, 1508, 1509, 1510 are about new features or announcements, so they also become events. \n\nNow, checking for organizations. The environments mentioned are Cloud Foundry, which is an SAP product, so that's an organization. Also, SAP Datasphere, SAP AI Core, SAP AI Launchpad, and Aleph Alpha are mentioned. These should be organizations. \n\nGEO isn't mentioned in any of the records, so no geo entities. \n\nFor relationships, each event is related to the component (like Variant Configuration, SAP Datasphere, etc.) as an organization. Also, Aleph Alpha is an organization supporting models in some events. \n\nI need to make sure all entity names are uppercase and descriptions are under 25 words. Relationships should link events to organizations or other entities with a valid description and strength. \n\nLet me structure each entity and relationship step by step, ensuring compliance with the rules.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>PRODUCTION - CONFIGURATIONS API – RAISE CONFLICT FOR NON-UNIQUE INFERENCE — 2025-02-05<|>EVENT<|>CONFIGURATIONS API NOW SIGNALS CONFLICT INSTEAD OF RAISING EXCEPTION FOR NON-UNIQUE VARIANT TABLE INFERENCE>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRODUCTION – CONFIGURATIONS API – AVC FORWARDING – ENSURE SORT ORDER REMAINS STABLE — 2025-02-05<|>EVENT<|>PATCH REQUESTS NOW MAINTAIN SORT ORDER OF POSSIBLE VALUES DURING AVC FORWARDING>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRODUCTION – CONFIGURATIONS API – AVC FORWARDING – POSSIBLE VALUES: INCLUDE PRE-DEFINED CHARACTERISTIC VALUES — 2025-02-05<|>EVENT<|>PRE-DEFINED CHARACTERISTIC VALUES NOW INCLUDED IN POSSIBLE VALUES LIST FOR DATE/NUMERIC CHARACTERISTICS>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRODUCTION – CONFIGURATIONS API – EXCLUDE GLOBALLY ASSIGNED CHARACTERISTICS — 2025-02-05<|>EVENT<|>GLOBALLY ASSIGNED CHARACTERISTICS NOW FILTERED OUT FROM CONFIGURATION RESULTS>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PRODUCTION – KNOWLEDGEBASES API – NEW FILTER TO READ VARIANT TABLE CONTENT — 2025-02-05<|>EVENT<|>NEW IN OPERATOR ADDED TO $FILTER PARAMETER FOR ADVANCED VARIANT TABLE QUERIES>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FEATURES FOR VERSION 2025.3 — 2025-02-04<|>EVENT<|>NEW AND CHANGED FEATURES AVAILABLE FOR SAP DATASPHHERE ADMINISTRATION AND DATA MODELING>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-02-03<|>EVENT<|>NEW PIPELINE API ENDPOINTS FOR DOCUMENT PROCESSING STATUS RETRIEVAL IN SAP AI CORE>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-02-03<|>EVENT<|>SUPPORT FOR SELECTED ALEPH ALPHA MODELS ADDED TO SAP AI CORE>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-02-03<|>EVENT<|>ADDITIONAL ALEPH ALPHA MODEL SUPPORT IN SAP AI LAUNCHPAD ORCHESTRATION>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-02-03<|>EVENT<|>GROUNDING MANAGEMENT APP FOR DATA PIPELINE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT IN SAP AI LAUNCHPAD>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP CLOUD PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT FOR APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP DATASPHHERE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYTICS PLATFORM>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP AI CORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT PLATFORM>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP AI LAUNCHPAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SAP USER-FACING AI APPLICATION ORCHESTRATION PLATFORM>)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ALEPH ALPHA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI MODEL PROVIDER SUPPORTED IN SAP AI CORE AND LAUNCHPAD>)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PRODUCTION - CONFIGURATIONS API – RAISE CONFLICT FOR NON-UNIQUE INFERENCE — 2025-02-05<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>EVENT OCCURS IN THIS CLOUD PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PRODUCTION – CONFIGURATIONS API – AVC FORWARDING – ENSURE SORT ORDER REMAINS STABLE — 2025-02-05<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>EVENT OCCURS IN THIS CLOUD PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PRODUCTION – CONFIGURATIONS API – AVC FORWARDING – POSSIBLE VALUES: INCLUDE PRE-DEFINED CHARACTERISTIC VALUES — 2025-02-05<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>EVENT OCCURS IN THIS CLOUD PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PRODUCTION – CONFIGURATIONS API – EXCLUDE GLOBALLY ASSIGNED CHARACTERISTICS — 2025-02-05<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>EVENT OCCURS IN THIS CLOUD PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>PRODUCTION – KNOWLEDGEBASES API – NEW FILTER TO READ VARIANT TABLE CONTENT — 2025-02-05<|>CLOUD FOUNDRY<|>EVENT OCCURS IN THIS CLOUD PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>FEATURES FOR VERSION 2025.3 — 2025-02-04<|>SAP DATASPHHERE<|>EVENT INVOLVES THIS DATA MANAGEMENT PLATFORM<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-02-03<|>SAP AI CORE<|>EVENT INVOLVES THIS AI DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-02-03<|>ALEPH ALPHA<|>EVENT INVOLVES THIS AI MODEL PROVIDER<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-02-03<|>SAP AI LAUNCHPAD<|>EVENT INVOLVES THIS AI ORCHESTRATION PLATFORM<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GENERATIVE AI HUB — 2025-02-03<|>ALEPH ALPHA<|>EVENT INVOLVES THIS AI MODEL PROVIDER<|>7)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758923163, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1791, "prompt_tokens": 3949, "total_tokens": 5740, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.44976718062073, "duration": 55.193}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
