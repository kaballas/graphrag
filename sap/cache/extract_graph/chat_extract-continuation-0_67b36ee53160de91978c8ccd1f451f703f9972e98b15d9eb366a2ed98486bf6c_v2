The Istio module now supports installation with Istio images injected into the installer from environment variables. This allows for more flexible deployments, especially in environments where images are not available in a public registry. See issue #1519.  Additionally, this release contains the following bug fixes:  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.  We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled. See issue #1523.  We've fixed a bug where the app.kubernetes.io/version label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources. See issue #1523.  We've fixed a bug where Istio sidecar injected as initContainer was not removed during Istio uninstallation.
