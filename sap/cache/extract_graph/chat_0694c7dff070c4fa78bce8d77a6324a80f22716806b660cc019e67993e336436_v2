The user provided some text from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the text. The main content here is about Joule supporting new capabilities in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2023 FPS01 and later. There are two records mentioned: one about performing release and acceptance of solution quotations and fetching information, and another about viewing business data in the Public Edition.\n\nLooking at the steps, I need to create EVENT entities for each release or new capability. The name pattern should be a short title followed by the date. The valid as of date for the first part is 2025-09-23, and the latest revision is 2025-10-20. But the user's example uses \"Valid as Of\" if available. So for the first event, the title would be \"JOULE SUPPORT FOR SOLUTION QUOTATIONS IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-09-23\". The description should mention the new features like releasing, accepting solution quotations, and fetching info.\n\nThe second record is about viewing business data in the Public Edition. The valid as of date is also 2025-09-23. So the event name would be \"JOULE SUPPORT FOR VIEWING BUSINESS DATA IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-09-23\". The description includes viewing condition records for pricing in sales.\n\nNow, checking for organizations. SAP S/4HANA Cloud is mentioned, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we don't emit products/services. However, the user's examples include SAP as an organization. Wait, the entity types here are organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and Public Edition. But the rules say if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, don't emit products/services. However, in the examples, SAP BTP was considered an organization. Wait, the user's example D had Microsoft Azure as an organization. So maybe SAP is considered an organization here. But the text says \"SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\" which is a product. But the rules state that if TECHNOLOGY is not in the allowed types, don't emit products. However, the entity_types given here include organization, so maybe SAP is considered an organization. But the text doesn't explicitly name a company, just the product. Hmm, this is tricky. The user's example D had Microsoft Azure as the organization, which is a service provider. In this case, the text mentions SAP S/4HANA Cloud, which is a product of SAP. But the entity_types include organization, so maybe SAP is the organization here. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention \"SAP\" as the organization, just the product. Wait, the title of the first record is \"New Use Cases Now Supported in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2023 FPS01 release onwards\". So the organization here would be SAP. But the rules say to emit ORGANIZATION only if explicitly mentioned. The text does mention SAP S/4HANA Cloud, which is a product of SAP. But the user's example D had Microsoft Azure as the organization. So maybe in this case, SAP is the organization. However, the text doesn't explicitly state \"SAP\" as the organization, just the product. This might be a case where the organization isn't explicitly mentioned, so we might not emit it. Alternatively, since the product is part of SAP, maybe we can infer SAP as the organization. But according to the rules, we need to emit ORGANIZATION only if explicitly mentioned. Since the text doesn't mention \"SAP\" as the organization, just the product, perhaps we shouldn't emit it. Therefore, no organization entities here.\n\nFor GEO, there's no mention of locations, so no GEO entities. PERSON isn't mentioned either. So the only entities are the two EVENTS. \n\nNow, relationships. The events are related to SAP S/4HANA Cloud, but since we didn't emit the organization, there's no relationship. So no relationships to emit. \n\nSo the output would be the two EVENT entities with their descriptions, and no relationships.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE SUPPORT FOR SOLUTION QUOTATIONS IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PRIVATE EDITION — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>Joule enables release/acceptance of solution quotations and fetching quotation info in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2023 FPS01+<|>  \n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE SUPPORT FOR VIEWING BUSINESS DATA IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2025-09-23<|>EVENT<|>Joule allows viewing condition records for pricing in sales within SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition<|>  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921385, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1097, "prompt_tokens": 2569, "total_tokens": 3666, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 35.82157784743992, "duration": 30.624}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
