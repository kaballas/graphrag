These new procedures split the update process into three phases: a preparation phase, a short takeover phase, and a postprocessing phase. The preparation phase installs the updated software version into a shadow layer of the system. The takeover phase switches to the new software version. As part of the takeover, running ABAP applications are terminated and new sessions will start on the new software version. This takeover induces a short downtime of the system in the area of seconds up to a minute. Finalization tasks and clean-up steps run in the postprocessing phase. Both the preparation phase as well as the postprocessing phase run in the background during uptime of the system. Some lifecycle management activities, like the import of transports or tenant creation, are blocked during the preparation phase. These downtime improvements become effective with the first hotfix collection update of the 2508 release.\";\"Info only\";\"General Availability\";\"New\";\"Technology\";\"2025-09-03\";\"2025-08-15\";\"ABAP Environment 2508\"\n\"ABAP Environment\";\"ABAP\";\"\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_94170db0cc5ce784386a6278be6102e6de035d52e5f1ab991976f37a92a1a6f9_v2"}
