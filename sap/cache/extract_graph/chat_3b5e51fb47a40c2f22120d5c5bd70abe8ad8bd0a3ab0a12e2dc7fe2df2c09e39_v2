The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided \"What's New\" records based on the given steps and examples. First, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events or other entities.\n\nStarting with Record 1221: The title is \"New Statuses in Temporary Storage Chart\" under Cloud Integration. The description mentions adding statuses to the Temporary Storage chart in the Inspect feature. Since this is a new feature, it's an EVENT. The entity name would be \"NEW STATUSES IN TEMPORARY STORAGE CHART — 2025-03-16\" with the description about the chart update.\n\nNext, Records 1222, 1223, 1224, 1225 are all Software Version Updates. These are changes, so they should be EVENTS. Each has a different component and environment. For example, Record 1222 is for SAP Cloud Integration 8.27.*. The event name would be \"SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-03-16\" with the version details. However, since the versions are different, I need to check if each should be a separate event. The user's examples show that even similar updates are treated as separate events if they're different versions. So each of these would be individual events.\n\nRecord 1226: \"Create Task from Model Dialog Enhanced\" in SAP Advanced Financial Closing. This is a new feature, so EVENT. The description mentions enhancements to the dialog, so the entity name would be \"CREATE TASK FROM MODEL DIALOG ENHANCED — 2025-03-16\" with the description about the search functionality.\n\nRecords 1227, 1228, 1229, 1230 are all new features in SAP Advanced Financial Closing. Each has a unique title, so each would be an EVENT. For example, Record 1227 is about the default value for approval type, so the event name would be \"DEFAULT VALUE FOR APPROVAL TYPE MASS CHANGES — 2025-03-16\".\n\nNow, checking for entities. The examples show that products/services like SAP Cloud Integration are not emitted as entities unless they're part of an organization. Since the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and the TECHNOLOGY is not allowed as an entity, these product names shouldn't be entities. Instead, the events are created for each new or changed feature.\n\nLooking for relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations if mentioned. However, in these records, there's no mention of specific organizations beyond the environments like Cloud Foundry or Neo. Since the user's examples don't include relationships unless there's a clear dependency, and these records don't mention organizations or locations, there might be no relationships to emit.\n\nWait, the environments are Cloud Foundry and Neo. But according to the steps, if TECHNOLOGY is not allowed as an entity, products/services/environments shouldn't be emitted. However, the user's examples (like Example D) include Microsoft Azure as an organization. But in this case, the environments are part of the SAP Cloud Foundry, which is a product. Since the entity types don't include TECHNOLOGY, these environments shouldn't be entities. Therefore, no relationships involving them.\n\nSo, all the extracted entities are EVENTS, and no relationships are present. Each record that's a new or changed feature becomes an EVENT entity. The descriptions are truncated to 25 words, and the event names follow the pattern <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE>.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW STATUSES IN TEMPORARY STORAGE CHART — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>Statuses now included in Temporary Storage chart in Inspect feature)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Integration updated to 8.27.*; increment 2501)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Integration updated to 6.63.*; increment 2501)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Integration updated to 5.71.*; increment 2501)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE VERSION UPDATE — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>SAP Cloud Integration updated to 7.36.*; phased rollout planned)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CREATE TASK FROM MODEL DIALOG ENHANCED — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>Search for task models while keeping other models selected in dialog)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DEFAULT VALUE FOR APPROVAL TYPE MASS CHANGES — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>Default approval type set to Completed Approval Required during mass changes)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DRAFT EXISTS COLUMN ADDED — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>New column added to sort/filter/export folder editing statuses)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>LANGUAGE SCOPE FOR DOCUMENTATION INCREASED — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>SAP Help Portal documentation now available in additional languages)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW APP FOR TASK MODEL MANAGEMENT — 2025-03-16<|>EVENT<|>Manage Task Models app released for task model overview)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926800, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1245, "prompt_tokens": 3965, "total_tokens": 5210, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.88083667863934, "duration": 37.864}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
