The user provided a text about an ABAP Environment update. The task is to extract entities and relationships based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, I need to check the entity types allowed: organization, person, geo, event. The text mentions \"ABAP Environment\" and \"SAPUI5 version 1.133.2\". But according to the steps, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we shouldn't emit products/services as entities. However, the user's example D included Microsoft Azure as an organization, so maybe if the entity is explicitly named, like SAP or Microsoft, it's allowed.\n\nLooking at the text, \"ABAP Environment\" is part of SAP BTP, but the entity types don't include technology. So, I shouldn't emit ABAP Environment as an entity. The description mentions SAPUI5 version, but that's a technology, not an organization, person, geo, or event. \n\nNext, check for events. The text says \"As part of hotfix collection 3... SAPUI5 version 1.133.2 is used...\" This seems like a new feature or update, so an EVENT entity. The title is \"Referenced SAPUI5 Version\", and the valid as of date is 2025-05-16. So the event name would be \"REFERENCED SAPUI5 VERSION — 2025-05-16\". The description should mention the version and its usage in the ABAP Environment.\n\nNo organizations, people, or geos are mentioned explicitly. The only entity is the event. Relationships aren't needed since there's no mention of locations or organizations involved. So the output should be the event entity only.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>REFERENCED SAPUI5 VERSION — 2025-05-16<|>EVENT<|>ABAP Environment uses SAPUI5 version 1.133.2 for Fiori launchpad and apps via hotfix collection 3)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925838, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 431, "prompt_tokens": 2868, "total_tokens": 3299, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 33.169154994612896, "duration": 12.994}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
