The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events, organizations, geos, and people. Let's start with Record 3681. The title is \"Inventory Settlement Report\" and the description mentions updates to the report with a new filter. Since there's a \"Valid as Of\" date (2024-01-07), this should be an EVENT. The entity name would be \"INVENTORY SETTLEMENT REPORT UPDATE — 2024-01-07\" with a description about the new filter and required actions.\n\nNext, Record 3682 talks about a vertical layout in the Process Editor available in specific regions. The regions listed are Australia (Sydney), US Central (IA), Europe (Frankfurt), Japan (Tokyo). These are GEO entities. The event here is the \"VERTICAL LAYOUT IN PROCESS EDITOR — 2024-01-07\" with a description about the layout features. Relationships would link the event to each GEO location.\n\nRecord 3683 mentions a breaking change requiring a cluster region for Kyma runtime. The event is \"CLUSTER REGION MANDATORY FOR KYMA RUNTIME — 2024-01-06\". The organization here is \"KYM A RUNTIME\" (though need to check if that's a valid org name). Wait, the component is Kyma Runtime, but the environment is Kyma. The description says \"Kyma runtime\" so maybe the organization is \"KYM A RUNTIME\" but I need to check if that's an actual organization. However, according to the rules, ORGANIZATION must be explicitly mentioned. The text doesn't mention an organization, so maybe no org here. The event is the breaking change.\n\nRecord 3684 discusses integrating SAP S/4HANA with Google Workspace. The event is \"INTEGRATING SAP S/4HANA WITH GOOGLE WORKSPACE — 2024-01-04\". The organization here is \"GOOGLE WORKSPACE\" (as part of Google, but the example D used \"MICROSOFT AZURE\" as an organization. So \"GOOGLE WORKSPACE\" would be an organization. Also, the component is Document Management Service, but that's a product, not an organization. So the event is the integration, and the organization is Google Workspace.\n\nRecord 3685 is a regular upgrade for Identity Authentication. The event is \"IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION UPGRADE — 2024-01-04\". No specific organizations mentioned here, so just the event.\n\nRecord 3686 is about using comments for feedback in documentation. The text is incomplete, so maybe no entity here.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. For the vertical layout event (Record 3682), it's available in Sydney, Australia; US Central (IA); Frankfurt, Europe; Tokyo, Japan. So each of these GEOs would have a relationship with the event. The strength would be around 8-9 since it's availability in those regions.\n\nFor the Google Workspace integration (Record 3684), the event involves the organization Google Workspace. So a relationship between the event and Google Workspace with strength 9.\n\nOther events don't have clear relationships. The Kyma Runtime breaking change (Record 3683) might involve Kyma Runtime as an organization, but the rules say to avoid products/services unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. Since Kyma Runtime is a component, not an organization, maybe no org here. So just the event.\n\nNow, ensuring all entity types are correct. GEOs are real places: Sydney, Australia; US Central (IA) – but IA is Iowa, so maybe \"US CENTRAL (IA)\" as a GEO? The example D used \"SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA\" as a GEO. So I'll take the regions as given, even if they have codes. The description should mention the regions where the layout is available.\n\nAlso, checking the entity names are uppercase. For example, \"INVENTORY SETTLEMENT REPORT UPDATE — 2024-01-07\" becomes uppercase. Descriptions are under 25 words.\n\nFinally, compiling all entities and relationships, ensuring no invalid types and proper formatting.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>INVENTORY SETTLEMENT REPORT UPDATE — 2024-01-07<|>EVENT<|>Inventory Settlement report updated with Tax-Dependent Material Group filter; requires master data maintenance and SAP Analytics Cloud content import)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>VERTICAL LAYOUT IN PROCESS EDITOR — 2024-01-07<|>EVENT<|>Vertical layout available in Process Editor with drag-and-drop steps, embedded help, and improved navigation for business processes)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Region where vertical layout in Process Editor is available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>US CENTRAL (IA)<|>GEO<|>Region where vertical layout in Process Editor is available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKFURT, EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Region where vertical layout in Process Editor is available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>TOKYO, JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Region where vertical layout in Process Editor is available)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CLUSTER REGION MANDATORY FOR KYMA RUNTIME — 2024-01-06<|>EVENT<|>Kyma runtime provisioning now requires cluster region selection in SAP BTP cockpit or CLI)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATING SAP S/4HANA WITH GOOGLE WORKSPACE — 2024-01-04<|>EVENT<|>Updated destination configuration for SAP Document Management Service integration with Google Workspace)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE WORKSPACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud collaboration platform integrated with SAP Document Management Service)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION UPGRADE — 2024-01-04<|>EVENT<|>Cloud Identity Services upgraded identity authentication components)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>VERTICAL LAYOUT IN PROCESS EDITOR — 2024-01-07<|>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA<|>Event available in this geographic region<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>VERTICAL LAYOUT IN PROCESS EDITOR — 2024-01-07<|>US CENTRAL (IA)<|>Event available in this geographic region<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>VERTICAL LAYOUT IN PROCESS EDITOR — 2024-01-07<|>FRANKFURT, EUROPE<|>Event available in this geographic region<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>VERTICAL LAYOUT IN PROCESS EDITOR — 2024-01-07<|>TOKYO, JAPAN<|>Event available in this geographic region<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEGRATING SAP S/4HANA WITH GOOGLE WORKSPACE — 2024-01-04<|>GOOGLE WORKSPACE<|>Event involves integration with this organization<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926905, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1636, "prompt_tokens": 3907, "total_tokens": 5543, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.25997278804251, "duration": 50.713}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Once the report has been generated, you can use this filter in the report to view the data for specific tax-dependent material groups.  Note  In order for this feature to work correctly, you must perform the following actions:    Maintain the tax-dependent material groups for your master data in the Edit Excise Tax Material Master Data app.      Import the latest SAP Analytics Cloud content for the standard reports from the content network into your SAP Analytics Cloud tenant. For more information, see Importing SAP Analytics Cloud Content for Legal Reports.      Update custom reports (if you have any) with the new changes seen in the standard reports. We recommend that you implement your customizations again on top of the latest SAP Analytics Cloud content for the standard reports.    \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: General Availability\nType: New\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2024-01-01\nValid as Of: 2024-01-07\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3682 ---\nComponent: SAP Build Process Automation\nEnvironment: Cloud Foundry\nTitle: Vertical Layout in Process Editor\nDescription: The vertical layout is available in the following regions:      Australia (Sydney)(cf-ap10)      US Central (IA) (cf-us30)      Europe (Frankfurt) (cf-eu11)      Japan (Tokyo) (cf-jp10)      See the documentation marked as early adopter version at: Business Process Projects.  These are some of the advantages that the new layout offers you:      To move process steps that have already been connected to the process, you simply select the step and drag and drop them.      You can access embedded help using the question mark button (?). In the Help Panel, you can navigate between the help for UI elements, the embedded What's New, and the Guided Tours.      If, for example, the outcome of an approval step in your process is “reject”, you can insert a go-to step and send users back to a previous step asking them to rework their entries.  See Use Cases for Custom Variables.      The side panel is wider and easier to work with. You can close it to save space. To display process information again, use the toggle button in the side panel.      You can select the next step to insert in your process from the smart menu.  See step 6 in Create a Business Process.      Steps with more than one flow are visualized as a group. You can collapse groups to get a better overview of the whole process.      The process is always valid, there are no more dangling ends. If you add a new step, for example, an approval form, all output paths are connected. You do not have to connect, for example, the Reject outcome to the process anymore.    \nAction: Info only\nLifecycle: Restricted Availability\nType: Changed\nLine of Business: Technology\nLatest Revision: 2023-12-21\nValid as Of: 2024-01-07\nVersion: Cloud\n\n--- Record 3683 ---\nComponent: Kyma Runtime\nEnvironment: Kyma\nTitle: Breaking change - cluster region mandatory for enabling Kyma runtime\nDescription: As we announced in this release note, the Region parameter is mandatory for provisioning Kyma runtime in your cluster.
