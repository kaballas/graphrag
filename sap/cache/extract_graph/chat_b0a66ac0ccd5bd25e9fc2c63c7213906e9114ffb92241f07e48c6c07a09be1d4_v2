The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" records based on the given examples and rules. First, I need to go through each record and determine if they qualify as events or other entities.\n\nStarting with Record 1341: It's about adding a link to tasks in email notifications for SAP Build Process Automation. Since it's a new feature, that's an EVENT. The title mentions \"Link to the Task in Email Notification\" with a valid date. The entity name would be \"LINK TO TASK IN EMAIL NOTIFICATION — 2025-02-24\" as an EVENT. The description should mention the email notifications including task details and a direct link.\n\nNext, Record 1342: Adding OData service to Java projects in SAP Business Application Studio. Another new feature, so EVENT. Entity name: \"ADD ODATA SERVICE TO JAVA PROJECT — 2025-02-23\". Description about adding OData service from Service Center.\n\nRecord 1343: Decommissioning an API endpoint in SAP Document AI. This is a deprecation, so EVENT. Name: \"DECOMMISSIONING ENRICHMENT DATA API ENDPOINT — 2025-02-20\". Description mentions the endpoint being decommissioned and the replacement.\n\nRecord 1344: Deprecation of SAP Belize themes in SAP Build Work Zone. EVENT: \"DEPRECATION OF SAP BELIZE THEMES — 2025-02-20\". Description notes the themes are deprecated and where it's indicated.\n\nRecord 1345: Deprecation of Document API endpoint Get Request Payload. EVENT: \"DEPRECATION OF DOCUMENT API ENDPOINT — 2025-02-20\". Description includes the deprecation and scheduled decommissioning.\n\nRecord 1346: Same as 1344 but for SAP Start. EVENT: \"DEPRECATION OF SAP BELIZE THEMES — 2025-02-20\" again, but need to check if it's a duplicate. Wait, the component is different (SAP Start vs SAP Build Work Zone), but the title is the same. However, the user might consider them separate events if the component is different. But the description is similar. Maybe they are separate entities. So, same entity name but different components? But the rules say to use the text as is. Hmm, but the title is the same. Maybe it's the same event but in different components. However, the user examples don't have duplicates, so perhaps treat them as separate events. Wait, the title is \"SAP Belize Themes Were Deprecated\" in both, but the components are different. So, the entity name would be the same, but the description would mention the component. But according to the rules, the entity name is based on the text. So maybe they are the same event. But the user might want to capture both. This is a bit tricky. Let me check the example D where the same product was mentioned in different contexts but treated as separate entities. Maybe here, since the components are different, they are separate events. However, the title is the same. Alternatively, maybe the entity name should include the component. But the example in the user's instruction for Example D didn't include the component in the event name. So perhaps the event name is based on the title, not the component. So, both would be the same event. But the user might want to capture both. Hmm, maybe I should create two separate events with the same name but different descriptions mentioning the different components. But the rules don't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that even if the title is the same, if the component is different, it's a separate event. But the example in the user's instruction for Example C had a single event. I think I'll proceed with creating two separate events for 1344 and 1346, even if the title is the same, because the components are different. So, for 1344: \"DEPRECATION OF SAP BELIZE THEMES — 2025-02-20\" with description mentioning SAP Build Work Zone. For 1346: same name but description mentions SAP Start.\n\nRecord 1347: Root certificate replacement in SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime. This is an EVENT. Name: \"ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2025-02-20\". Description about switching to DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5 and Global Root G3. Also, need to check if DigiCert is an organization. Yes, so that's an ORGANIZATION entity. Also, the date mentioned in the description is July 2025, but the valid as of is 2025-02-20. The rules say to use \"Valid as Of\" if present. So the event date is 2025-02-20. The relationship would be between the event and DigiCert as the organization.\n\nRecord 1348: Apache TomEE 10 in SAP Java Buildpack. This is a new feature, so EVENT. Name: \"APACHE TOMEE 10 IN SAP JAVA BUILDPACK — 2025-02-20\". Description mentions providing Apache TomEE 10.\n\nRecord 1349: Changing default service plan of autoscaler to standard. This is a change, so EVENT. Name: \"CHANGED DEFAULT SERVICE PLAN OF AUTOSCALER — 2025-02-20\". Description about changing from lite to standard.\n\nNow, for relationships. For the root certificate replacement event (Record 1347), the relationship is with DigiCert Global Root G3 and DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5 as organizations. The event uses their certificates. So two relationships: event to each organization with strength 9.\n\nOther events don't mention organizations or geos, so no relationships. The other events are about features, deprecations, etc., which don't involve organizations or geos. So only the root certificate replacement has relationships.\n\nNow, check entity types. All events are EVENT. The organizations are DigiCert Global Root G3 and DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5. Need to make sure they are in uppercase. Also, check if any other entities are present. The other records don't mention organizations, persons, or geos, so only the events and the two organizations from Record 1347.\n\nSo the final output would list all the events and the two organizations, then the relationships between the event and the organizations.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>LINK TO TASK IN EMAIL NOTIFICATION — 2025-02-24<|>EVENT<|>Email notifications now include task details and direct action links to complete tasks in My Inbox or SAP Task Center)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ADD ODATA SERVICE TO JAVA PROJECT — 2025-02-23<|>EVENT<|>OData service can now be added to Java projects via Service Center in SAP Business Application Studio)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DECOMMISSIONING ENRICHMENT DATA API ENDPOINT — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>Delete Enrichment Data (Synchronous) endpoint decommissioned; use Delete Enrichment Data instead)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DEPRECATION OF SAP BELIZE THEMES — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>SAP Belize themes deprecated in SAP Build Work Zone, indicated next to theme names in Settings > Appearance > Theme)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DEPRECATION OF DOCUMENT API ENDPOINT — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>Get Request Payload (Deprecated) endpoint scheduled for decommissioning in September 2025)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DEPRECATION OF SAP BELIZE THEMES — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>SAP Belize themes deprecated in SAP Start, indicated next to theme names under Settings > Appearance > Theme)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>SAP switches to DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5 and DigiCert Global Root G3 for quantum-safe cryptography in July 2025)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>APACHE TOMEE 10 IN SAP JAVA BUILDPACK — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>SAP Java Buildpack 2 now provides Apache TomEE 10 Plume distribution for Jakarta-based applications)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>CHANGED DEFAULT SERVICE PLAN OF AUTOSCALER — 2025-02-20<|>EVENT<|>Autoscaler MTA resource type default plan changed from lite to standard for broader BTP account compatibility)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority providing root certificates for SAP BTP's quantum-safe cryptography transition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT TLS RSA4096 ROOT G5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority providing root certificates for SAP BTP's quantum-safe cryptography transition)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2025-02-20<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event involves organization's certificate infrastructure<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2025-02-20<|>DIGICERT TLS RSA4096 ROOT G5<|>Event involves organization's certificate infrastructure<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926163, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2144, "prompt_tokens": 3945, "total_tokens": 6089, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.51440703670003, "duration": 65.94}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
