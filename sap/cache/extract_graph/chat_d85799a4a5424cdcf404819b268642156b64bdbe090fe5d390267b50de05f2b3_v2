The user provided some real data from SAP's \"What's New\" release notes and wants me to extract entities and relationships based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. There are three records here. Let's look at each one.\n\nStarting with Record 269: The title is \"Deprecated CDS Views in Business Event Logging\". The description mentions deprecating specific CDS views and their successors. According to the steps, when TECHNOLOGY isn't an allowed entity type (which it isn't here), changes should be represented as EVENT entities. So, I need to create an EVENT entity for this deprecation. The name should follow the pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE>. The valid as of date is 2025-08-15. The description should mention the deprecated views and their replacements. \n\nNext, Record 270: Title is \"Expose Extensibility Status in Open Resource Discovery Document for Business Events\". This is a new feature. Again, since it's a new capability, it's an EVENT. The name would be similar, using the title and date. The description should note that the Open Resource Discovery document now exposes extensibility status.\n\nRecord 268: The first line is \"RAP - with cross associations RAP - AssocImplType\". The description isn't provided here, but the title seems to be about RAP (maybe a product or feature). However, the user's examples show that if TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed, products/services aren't emitted as entities. Since the entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and RAP might be a technology, but it's not explicitly mentioned as an organization. So, maybe this isn't an entity. The description is missing, so perhaps this record doesn't qualify for an event either. Wait, the user's examples show that even if the text is about a technology, if it's not in the allowed entity types, it's represented as an EVENT. But in this case, the title is unclear. Maybe it's a new feature, so an EVENT. However, without a clear description, it's hard to form a proper event. The user's examples include \"Enhancements to Joule...\" which had a description. Since this record's description is missing, maybe it's not included. The user's instruction says to drop offending items if validation fails. So, if the description is missing, maybe this record is dropped. \n\nSo, focusing on Records 269 and 270. Both are under ABAP Environment, which is a technology. Since TECHNOLOGY isn't an allowed entity type, we don't emit ABAP Environment as an organization. Instead, the changes are events. \n\nFor Record 269: Event name would be \"DEPRECATED CDS VIEWS IN BUSINESS EVENT LOGGING — 2025-08-15\". Description: \"Deprecated CDS views C_BUSEVTLOGEVENTDEX_2 and C_BUEVLGEVTFULLPAYLOADJSONDEX; successors are C_BUSEVTLOGEVENTDEX_3 and C_BUEVLGEVTFULLPYLDJSONDEX_2.\"\n\nFor Record 270: Event name \"EXPOSE EXTENSIBILITY STATUS IN OPEN RESOURCE DISCOVERY DOCUMENT FOR BUSINESS EVENTS — 2025-08-15\". Description: \"Open Resource Discovery document for business events now exposes extensibility status.\"\n\nNow, relationships. The examples show relationships between events and organizations or geos. But in these cases, there's no mention of organizations or geos. The events are about ABAP Environment, but since that's a technology and not an allowed entity, we can't link it. So, no relationships here. \n\nSo the output would be two EVENT entities and no relationships. Need to check if the entity types are correct. Both are EVENT. Descriptions are under 25 words. No other entities. Relationships are none. So the final output should be those two events.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPRECATED CDS VIEWS IN BUSINESS EVENT LOGGING — 2025-08-15<|>EVENT<|>Deprecated CDS views C_BUSEVTLOGEVENTDEX_2 and C_BUEVLGEVTFULLPAYLOADJSONDEX; successors are C_BUSEVTLOGEVENTDEX_3 and C_BUEVLGEVTFULLPYLDJSONDEX_2)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>EXPOSE EXTENSIBILITY STATUS IN OPEN RESOURCE DISCOVERY DOCUMENT FOR BUSINESS EVENTS — 2025-08-15<|>EVENT<|>Open Resource Discovery document for business events now exposes extensibility status)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758926750, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 995, "prompt_tokens": 3021, "total_tokens": 4016, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 32.19960519077053, "duration": 30.901}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
