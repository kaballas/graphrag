The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP release notes based on the given examples and rules. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each record and identify events. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event. Since the text mentions Joule and other components like SAP BTP Cockpit, but the entity types don't include technology, I need to make sure not to list products as entities unless they're part of an event.\n\nLooking at Record 21: The title is \"Enhancement to Create Time Off - August 2025\". The valid as of date is 2025-08-19. This seems like an event. The description mentions an enhancement to the \"Create time off\" use case. So, the event name would be \"ENHANCEMENT TO CREATE TIME OFF — 2025-08-19\" with a description about the half-day absence change.\n\nRecord 22: Title is about new use cases for Finance Management Controlling. The valid date is 2025-08-19. This is a new feature, so an event. The description lists several use cases added. The event name would be \"NEW USE CASES FOR FINANCE MANAGEMENT CONTROLLING — 2025-08-19\" with the description mentioning the added use cases.\n\nRecord 23: Processing In-House Services. Valid as of 2025-08-19. Another new feature, so event. The event name would be \"PROCESSING IN-HOUSE SERVICES — 2025-08-19\" with the description about the supported use cases.\n\nRecord 24: Support Extended for Subscription Order Management. Valid as of 2025-08-19. This is an announcement, so event. The event name would be \"SUPPORT EXTENDED FOR SUBSCRIPTION ORDER MANAGEMENT — 2025-08-19\" with the description about the capabilities added.\n\nRecord 25: Enhanced Intelligent Scenarios in Sales. Valid as of 2025-08-15. The title mentions enhancement, so event. The event name would be \"ENHANCED INTELLIGENT SCENARIOS IN SALES — 2025-08-15\" with the description about the AI scenarios and prioritization.\n\nRecord 26: New Use Cases in Sales. Valid as of 2025-08-15. This is a new feature, so event. The event name would be \"NEW USE CASES IN SALES — 2025-08-15\" with the list of use cases added.\n\nRecord 27: Document Grounding Capability changes. Valid as of 2025-08-01. This is a change, so event. The event name would be \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING PIPELINE PROCESSING UPDATES — 2025-08-01\" with the description about the new attributes and pagination.\n\nRecord 28: New Navigational Use Cases in SAP BTP Cockpit. The component includes SAP BTP Cockpit, which is an organization. The valid date isn't provided, but the latest revision is 2025-08-01. The event name would be \"NEW NAVIGATIONAL USE CASES IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-08-01\" with the description about the navigational features. Also, SAP BTP Cockpit is an organization, so that's an entity.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. For example, the event in Record 28 involves SAP BTP Cockpit as the organization. So, the relationship would be between the event and SAP BTP Cockpit, indicating the event involves the organization's infrastructure. Similarly, other events might relate to SAP BTP Cockpit if mentioned, but looking at the records, only Record 28 mentions SAP BTP Cockpit explicitly. The other records mention Joule, which is a product, but since TECHNOLOGY isn't allowed as an entity, we don't list it. \n\nSo, the entities would be the events and the organization SAP BTP Cockpit. Relationships would link the event in Record 28 to SAP BTP Cockpit. The other events don't mention specific organizations, so no relationships there. \n\nI need to make sure all entity names are uppercase, descriptions are under 25 words, and relationships are correctly formatted. Also, check that no products are listed as entities unless part of an event. Since the user specified that when TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, products are represented as events, which they are here.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCEMENT TO CREATE TIME OFF — 2025-08-19<|>EVENT<|>Enhancement to \"Create time off\" use case for half-day absence management in Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES FOR FINANCE MANAGEMENT CONTROLLING — 2025-08-19<|>EVENT<|>New Joule use cases added for Finance Management Controlling in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESSING IN-HOUSE SERVICES — 2025-08-19<|>EVENT<|>Joule now supports use cases for in-house service objects in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SUPPORT EXTENDED FOR SUBSCRIPTION ORDER MANAGEMENT — 2025-08-19<|>EVENT<|>Joule supports subscription order management capabilities for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2023 FPS01+)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>ENHANCED INTELLIGENT SCENARIOS IN SALES — 2025-08-15<|>EVENT<|>Intelligent scenarios (SD_INT_AI_GEMINI, SD_INT_AI_GPT) activated for Sales in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASES IN SALES — 2025-08-15<|>EVENT<|>Joule supports new transactional use cases for Sales in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING PIPELINE PROCESSING UPDATES — 2025-08-01<|>EVENT<|>Pipeline API endpoints now include document processing statuses and pagination support in Joule)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW NAVIGATIONAL USE CASES IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-08-01<|>EVENT<|>Joule in SAP BTP Cockpit now navigates to applications, events, and HANA Cloud instances)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>SAP BTP COCKPIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud platform providing navigational capabilities for Joule in Cloud Foundry spaces)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW NAVIGATIONAL USE CASES IN SAP BTP COCKPIT — 2025-08-01<|>SAP BTP COCKPIT<|>Event involves organization's infrastructure<|>9)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921692, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1584, "prompt_tokens": 3551, "total_tokens": 5135, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 29.60470984020185, "duration": 53.505}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.
