The user wants me to extract entities and relationships from the provided SAP \"What's New\" release notes based on specific guidelines. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, and event. Products, services, environments shouldn't be emitted as entities unless TECHNOLOGY is allowed, but in this case, the user hasn't specified TECHNOLOGY, so I need to represent changes as EVENT entities.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each record and check for events. Each record has a title and description, along with dates like \"Valid as Of\" or \"Latest Revision.\" The event name should be the title followed by the date, using \"Valid as Of\" if available. \n\nLooking at Record 91: The title is \"Integration with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.\" The Valid as Of date is 2024-12-09. So the event name would be \"INTEGRATION WITH SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2024-12-09.\" The description mentions automatic creation of NavigationService destination, which is a new capability. That's a valid event.\n\nRecord 92: Title is \"Joule Now Available in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.\" Valid as Of is 2024-12-06. The event name would be \"JOULE NOW AVAILABLE IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2024-12-06.\" The description talks about availability for various use cases, so that's an event.\n\nRecord 93: Title is \"Joule for Mobile Devices Using SAP Mobile Start.\" Valid as Of 2024-12-03. Event name: \"JOULE FOR MOBILE DEVICES USING SAP MOBILE START — 2024-12-03.\" The description mentions mobile access, so that's an event.\n\nRecord 94: Title \"SAP SuccessFactors Use Cases Now Supported in SAP Mobile Start.\" Valid as Of 2024-12-03. Event name: \"SAP SUCCESSFACTORS USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP MOBILE START — 2024-12-03.\" The description says users can access Joule via SAP Mobile Start for SuccessFactors, which is a new use case.\n\nRecord 95: Title \"Document Grounding Capability - Support to Documents in Static HTML File Format.\" Valid as Of 2024-11-22. Event name: \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY - SUPPORT TO DOCUMENTS IN STATIC HTML FILE FORMAT — 2024-11-22.\" The description adds support for static HTML, a new feature.\n\nRecord 96: Title \"New Conversational Experience and Use Cases in Joule.\" Valid as Of 2024-11-15. Event name: \"NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND USE CASES IN JOULE — 2024-11-15.\" The description introduces a new conversational experience, so that's an event.\n\nRecord 97: Title \"Joule Conversational Search Now Supported in SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain.\" Valid as Of 2024-10-31. Event name: \"JOULE CONVERSATIONAL SEARCH NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP INTEGRATED BUSINESS PLANNING FOR SUPPLY CHAIN — 2024-10-31.\" The description allows conversational access to SAP IBP documentation, a new capability.\n\nRecord 98: Title \"Document Grounding Capability - SharePoint Granularity.\" Valid as Of 2024-10-25. Event name: \"DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY - SHAREPOINT GRANULARITY — 2024-10-25.\" The description adds SharePoint folder granularity, a new feature.\n\nRecord 99: Title \"Authentication of Requests; Single Logout.\" Latest Revision is 2024-11-27, but Valid as Of is 2024-10-25. The event name would use the Valid as Of date. The description mentions configuring SLO for Joule, which is a change, so that's an event.\n\nNow, checking for relationships. The problem states to emit relationships only if there's a clear dependency or impact between two entities. However, looking at the extracted events, none of them mention dependencies or impacts on other entities like organizations, people, or geos. All events are standalone features or capabilities. Therefore, there are no relationships to extract.\n\nEach event is a separate entity, and since there's no mention of how they relate to each other or other entities, the relationships section will be empty. The final output should list all the events followed by the relationships (which are none in this case).\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATION WITH SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2024-12-09<|>EVENT<|>NavigationService destination created automatically via Joule booster during integration setup)##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE NOW AVAILABLE IN SAP S/4HANA CLOUD PUBLIC EDITION — 2024-12-06<|>EVENT<|>Joule supports navigation to apps and viewing business data in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE FOR MOBILE DEVICES USING SAP MOBILE START — 2024-12-03<|>EVENT<|>Joule integrated with SAP Mobile Start for mobile device access)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAP SUCCESSFACTORS USE CASES NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP MOBILE START — 2024-12-03<|>EVENT<|>Joule accessible via SAP Mobile Start for SuccessFactors use cases)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY - SUPPORT TO DOCUMENTS IN STATIC HTML FILE FORMAT — 2024-11-22<|>EVENT<|>Static HTML document format now supported in document grounding capability)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW CONVERSATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND USE CASES IN JOULE — 2024-11-15<|>EVENT<|>Improved adaptive conversations and dialog management introduced in Joule)##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE CONVERSATIONAL SEARCH NOW SUPPORTED IN SAP INTEGRATED BUSINESS PLANNING FOR SUPPLY CHAIN — 2024-10-31<|>EVENT<|>Conversational access to SAP IBP documentation via Joule enabled)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCUMENT GROUNDING CAPABILITY - SHAREPOINT GRANULARITY — 2024-10-25<|>EVENT<|>SharePoint folder granularity added to document grounding data pipeline)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTHENTICATION OF REQUESTS; SINGLE LOGOUT — 2024-10-25<|>EVENT<|>Single logout configured for Joule sessions across applications)##\n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758921047, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1512, "prompt_tokens": 3018, "total_tokens": 4530, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 39.20450125755179, "duration": 38.567}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entity types, extract entities and relationships.\n\n-Steps-\nEntity extraction\n• Emit entities only if their type ∈ [organization,person,geo,event] after normalization to UPPERCASE.\n• When TECHNOLOGY is NOT in [organization,person,geo,event], do NOT emit products/services/environments as entities; represent such changes as EVENT entities.\n• PERSON must be a named individual.
