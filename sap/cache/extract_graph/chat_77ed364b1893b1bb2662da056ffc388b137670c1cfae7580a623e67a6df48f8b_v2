The user provided a real data example with two records related to Joule in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. The task is to extract entities and relationships based on the given steps.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the text and identify the key information. The main components here are the Joule Transactional Use Cases for Cash Management and the new use case for Field Logistics. Both are under the Cloud Foundry environment, with General Availability and a valid date of 2025-05-31.\n\nFor entity extraction, the guidelines say to create EVENT entities for releases, new capabilities, etc. The titles of the records are good candidates for event names. I'll format them as \"TITLE — VALID AS OF DATE\". \n\nLooking at the descriptions, the first event involves enabling cash management capabilities with Joule, including monitoring bank statements and initiating transfers. The second event adds a use case for fetching non-stock item quantities in Field Logistics. Both are new features, so they qualify as EVENTS.\n\nNext, check for organizations, GEOs, or other entities. The text mentions SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, but according to the rules, if TECHNOLOGY isn't in the allowed types, we don't emit products/services. However, the user's entity types include ORGANIZATION, so I need to check if any organizations are mentioned. The environment is Cloud Foundry, which is a service provided by SAP, but the user's example D included Microsoft Azure as an organization. However, in this case, the text doesn't explicitly mention an organization like SAP BTP or another company. The Line of Business is Technology, but that's not an entity. So maybe no organizations here except possibly SAP, but the text doesn't state it explicitly. The records mention SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, but the rules say not to emit products/services unless they are explicitly mentioned as organizations. Since SAP is an organization, but the text refers to the product, not the company itself, maybe we don't include it. So perhaps no ORGANIZATION entities here.\n\nGEOs: There's no mention of specific locations, so no GEO entities.\n\nSo the only entities are the two EVENTS. Now, relationships: the instructions say to emit relationships if there's a clear dependency between entities. Since there are only two events and no other entities, there's no relationship between them. The events are separate features, so no relationships to extract.\n\nCheck the output format: list all entities first, then relationships. Since there are no relationships, just the entities. Each entity should be in uppercase, with the event name, type, and description. The descriptions need to be under 25 words. Let me check the descriptions:\n\nFirst event: \"Joule Transactional Use Cases are now Enabled for Cash Management Capabilities in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\" becomes \"JOULE TRANSACTIONAL USE CASES ENABLED FOR CASH MANAGEMENT — 2025-05-31\" as the event name. The description would be \"Joule enables cash management features like monitoring bank statements, analyzing cash flow, and initiating transfers for efficient financial management.\"\n\nSecond event: \"New Use Case Now Supported for Field Logistics in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition\" becomes \"NEW USE CASE SUPPORTED FOR FIELD LOGISTICS — 2025-05-31\". Description: \"Supports fetching quantity for non-stock items in Field Logistics for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition.\"\n\nNo relationships, so the output is just the two entities.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>JOULE TRANSACTIONAL USE CASES ENABLED FOR CASH MANAGEMENT — 2025-05-31<|>EVENT<|>Joule enables cash management features like monitoring bank statements, analyzing cash flow, and initiating transfers for efficient financial management)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>NEW USE CASE SUPPORTED FOR FIELD LOGISTICS — 2025-05-31<|>EVENT<|>Supports fetching quantity for non-stock items in Field Logistics for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)  \n<|COMPLETE|>", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758925403, "model": "gpt-4o", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 868, "prompt_tokens": 2973, "total_tokens": 3841, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "outputTps": 31.292811305789893, "duration": 27.738}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "-Goal-\nGiven SAP “What’s New” release notes and a list of entityExample C\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,PERSON,GEO,EVENT\nText:\nEnhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors.

Do NOT output roles or groups.\n• GEO must be a real-world geography.\n• ORGANIZATION must be a company, institution, or service provider explicitly mentioned (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, SAP BTP).\n• Construct EVENT entities whenever a record describes a release, upgrade, deprecation, migration, fix, enablement, or new capability.\n  – Name pattern: <SHORT TITLE> — <ISO DATE if present> (prefer “Valid as Of”; else “Latest Revision”).\n• For each entity output:\n  – entity_name: UPPERCASED\n  – entity_type: One of [organization,person,geo,event] (UPPERCASED)\n  – entity_description: ≤25 words, factual, tied to the source text\n• Format:\n(\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nRelationship extraction\n• Use only entities emitted in step 1.\n• Emit a relationship only if the text states a clear dependency/impact between two emitted entities.\n• Valid relationships include: events occurring in locations, events involving organizations, organizations providing infrastructure.\n• relationship_description ≤20 words; relationship_strength ∈ {1..10}.\n• Format:\n(\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n-Output rules-\n• Return all entities and then relationships in a single flat list.\n• Separate items with ##.\n• End with <|COMPLETE|>.\n• If no relationships qualify, emit none.\n• If at least one record exists and TECHNOLOGY is not allowed, emit at least one EVENT per qualifying record.\n\n-Validation (drop offending item)-\n• No internal reasoning markers (e.g., <think>, analysis).\n• entity_type not in [organization,person,geo,event] → drop.\n• GEO not a real place → drop.\n• PERSON not a named individual → drop.\n• Products/services/environments emitted when TECHNOLOGY not allowed → drop.\n• Descriptions exceeding limits → truncate without changing meaning.\n• Case: entity_name and entity_type must be UPPERCASE.\n\n-Minimal Examples-\nExample A\nEntity_types: ORGANIZATION,EVENT\nText:\nSAP BTP Neo will switch to DigiCert Global Root G3 for all platform domains by April 2026.\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Certificate authority replacing DigiCert Global Root G2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>EVENT<|>Neo platform domains will use certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE REPLACEMENT — 2026-04-01<|>DIGICERT GLOBAL ROOT G3<|>Event uses certificates signed by this CA<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nExample B\nEntity_types: EVENT\nText:\nThe credential type instance-secret has reached end-of-life.
