Title: Multiple Subscriptions to SAP Build Work Zone Editions
Description: It's no longer possible to subscribe to multiple SAP Build Work Zone editions in parallel in a given SAP BTP subaccount. Trying to subscribe to multiple editions, for example both to standard and advanced editions in the same subaccount, will result in an error.   Note   Existing subscriptions are not impacted by this restriction and continue to work as before.  If you're interested in upgrading from the foundation service plan to the standard service plan, you can use the Updatesubscription option in the SAP BTP cockpit.  Note that the Updateoption is only available if the subaccount has entitlements to both the foundation and standard service plans.
