Title: Production- Configurations API – Lock Configurations Against Changes
Description: There is a new endpoint called PATCH /configurations/{configurationId}/lock to flag a configuration as locked or not locked. The default setting is not locked. If a configuration is locked, it cannot be deleted nor changed, for example, adding or removing a characteristic value or resetting the configuration is not possible.  Existing endpoints such as GET /configurations/{configurationId} will be enhanced to return the locked flag for a configuration.   The existing endpoint GET /externalConfigurations will be enhanced to allow searching for locked configurations.
