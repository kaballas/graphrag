Title: Istio module: Update to version 1.15.0
Description: To collect custom metrics from a workload that exposes its metrics endpoint on the same port as its business API, you must use mTLS for scraping. While Kyma Telemetry supports this scenario, other observability tools rely on the prometheusMerge feature of Istio. Now, you can enable this feature by setting the config.telemetry.metrics.prometheusMerge field in the Istio custom resource (CR).  When enabled, the Istio sidecar running with an application exposes an additional port 15020. This port exposes both the workload’s Istio metrics and the custom metrics, as specified by prometheus.io annotations. Istio automatically rewrites the annotations to direct to the new port, allowing metric collection without mTLS.  To disable this feature for a specific workload, you can use the prometheus.istio.io/merge-metrics: "false" annotation.
