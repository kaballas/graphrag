Title: New Cost Breakdown Charts in Costs and Usage Page
Description: In the Costs and Usage page in SAP BTP cockpit, we've added new cost and usage breakdown charts below the main table in the Billing and Usage views. Use these new charts to get a perspective of the costliest and most used subaccounts or service plans per month over the last 12 months.       In the Usage view, the new breakdown chart shows your subaccounts with the most usage for any service plan that you've selected in the main table.      In the Billing view, the new breakdown chart shows your costliest subaccounts or service plans. The scope and type of information displayed in the chart depends on whether you’ve selected the View by Service or View by Account perspective, and whether you’ve selected a row in the main table.   To view the cost breakdown of a specific service plan, directory, or subaccount, select it in the main table. A cost breakdown for the whole global account is presented when no row is select in the main table.      See Monitoring Usage and Consumption Costs in Your Global Account.

Title: Update Repositories API
Description: We've enhanced the Update Repositories and Onboarding Repositories API with a new fileExtensions parameter for onboarding internal repositories, allowing you to specify permitted and restricted MIME types at the repository level. These MIME type checks ensure that only allowed types are processed, enhancing efficient content management.   You can configure the list to allow or block different file types during repository onboarding or adjust them for existing repositories using the Update Repositories API. This update provides greater control, improved security, and flexibility in managing your repositories.  For more information, see Repository Configuration API published on the SAP Business Accelerator Hub and the updated parameter section in the help documentation Onboard Repository.
