Title: Cloud Connector 2.17.0 - Enhancements
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.17.0 provides the following enhancements:    Cloud Connector 2.17 is based on a different runtime container. So far, it was based on the JavaWeb 3.x runtime on Tomcat 8.5, now it switched to JavaWeb 4.x, which is based on Tomcat 9.  The Cloud Connector can now use SAPMachine 21 as Java runtime. For more information, see Prerequisites.  Cloud Connector 2.17 supports up to 3 LDAP servers for authentication. This allows to support setups in which the user base is not completely available in a single LDAP user store, or if there are multiple user bases in a single LDAP user store.For more information, see Use LDAP for User Administration.  You can configure a separate port for the high availability (HA)- related communication between the two instances (master and shadow). This lets you use HA together with certificate-based authentication.For more information, see Install a Failover Instance for High Availability.  Additional hardware monitoring REST APIs for disk and CPU status have been provided.For more information, see Monitoring APIs.  You can now use the hardware monitor on the shadow instance as well.For more information, see Hardware Metrics.  A description for subject patterns was introduced.For more information, see Configure Subject Patterns for Principal Propagation.  Access control data now contains the creation timestamp.For more information, see Configure Access Control.  You can now add a subaccount using an authentication data file downloaded from SAP BTP. For more information, see Set up Connection Parameters and HTTPS Proxy (steps 2 + 4: file-based subaccount configuration).   The Cloud Connector UI now provides a session expiration progress bar in the top right corner of each screen, indicating how long your current session is still valid until you need to login again before proceeding.For more information, see Initial Configuration.  You can now run the new script resetCiphers from the scc folder in the Cloud Connector installation directory to reset the ciphers if UI access is blocked due to wrong cipher settings. For more information on cipher suites, see Encryption Ciphers.

Title: Document Pricing - Enable SAP CPQ to Work With Alternative Units of Measure
Description: In pricing results, the conditions rates are returned as maintained. Only condition values are returned in the target document currency based on the item's target quantity and unit of measure. To help SAP CPQ to cope with condition rates that use alternative units of measure, the item condition details of endpoint GET /api/v1/pricing/documents/{documentId} is enhanced with a new field rateNormalized, which also considers the target currency and the sales unit of measure.  This field is for use in SAP CPQ only and may change becoming incompatible at any time when requested by SAP CPQ. Do not use this field in any other integrations.  See API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
