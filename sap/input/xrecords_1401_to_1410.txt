Title: ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse: Develop Custom Actions with the IDE Action Framework and Enhance Them with Server-Driven UI
Description: The IDE Action framework allows you to extend the ABAP development tools for Eclipse with custom actions. You can create and run IDE Actions, which are additional functionalities implemented completely in the backend. On top of that, you have the option to use server-driven UI APIs to build UIs, add parameters and additional configurations to your actions, such as side effects and custom value helps.  See IDE Actions and Working with Server-Driven UIs.

Title: ABAP SQL Service - (read-only) Database Procedures
Description: Have you already used the ABAP SQL Service / ODBC Driver for ABAP to expose ABAP-based business data via SQL-APIs to external SQL consumers? We are now increasing the feature scope for those scenarios. Besides exposing CDS view entities for read-only scenarios, it will be possible to also expose "read-only" AMDP-based database procedures to be used by external ODBC clients. By doing so, you can both expose SQL and SQLScript-based business logic to external ODBC clients.

Title: CDS Table Entities
Description: A new type of CDS entity is available: the CDS table entity. A CDS table entity defines a database table in ABAP CDS as an ABAP-managed database object. Table entities provide a persistence layer for ABAP applications that allows you to define and manage SAP HANA database tables as native CDS repository objects. The initial shipment of table entities supports CDS associations, CDS annotations, and typing with both CDS simple types and CDS enumerated types.

Title: CDS Updatable View Entities
Description: With CDS Writeable View Entities, you can wrap existing DDIC Tables (or CDS Table Entities) and expose a native CDS signature that you can use with ABAP SQL (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in combination with DCL-based access control. CDS Writeable View Entities are projections based on the underlying DDIC Table / CDS Table Entity.  CDS Writeable View Entities will allow the following scenarios:  Enabling of "Cloud-ready" READ/WRITE AMDPs, as they ensure "client safe" native HANA SQLScript coding by preventing cross-client access  Exposure of a stable CDS signature for full SQL DML access but still allowing changes to the underlying persistence model  Enabling the usage of Dynamic View Caches based on released SAP content  Enabling of WRITE scenarios via the ABAP SQL Service / ABAP ODBC Driver
