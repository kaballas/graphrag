Title: Manage Software Components app
Description: You can now not only use the Manage Software Components app to delete a software component only locally but also the structure package including all contained ABAP objects will be deleted from the system instance. After a successful deletion, the software component can be re-cloned again. This might be desirable if local (system instance-specific) inconsistencies occur, which should be resolved. For more information and warning messages, see How to Delete Software Components.
