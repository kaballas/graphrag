Title: Cloud Connector 2.18.0 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.18.0 provides the following bug fixes:    Custom roles are no longer overwritten on the shadow instance, when connecting to the master instance.  When upgrading an instance with a separate high availability (HA) port on Windows, the HA port is no longer adjusted to be the same like the UI port.

Title: Cloud Connector 2.18.0 - Enhancements
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.18.0 provides the following enhancements:    The Cloud Connector supports now Windows Server 2025 as additional OS version, and as announced previously, some OS versions will be no longer supported with 2.18. For more information, see Product Availability Matrix.  The Cloud Connector now supports automatic renewal of the subaccount certificate. Restriction  This feature is not supported for Neo regions.Restriction  Multi-cloud regions will not be enabled all at once.Once a region has been enabled, the Cloud Connector view in the SAP BTP cockpit will show a button to allow the automatic renewal for the current subaccount.For more information, see Renew the Certificate for a Subaccount.  The theme for the administration UI has been switched to Morning Horizon by default. In addition, you can configure your favorite theme of the Horizon suite. For more information, see Theming.  You can now manage the trust store for E-mails and LDAP servers within the Cloud Connector instead of using the JDK trust store. For more information, see LDAP Trust and E-Mail Trust.  A Troubleshooting section has been introduced that suggests solutions for problems detected within the Cloud Connector. In particular, business data tunnel failures will be reported with potential root causes. For more information, see Troubleshooting.  A cross-subaccount performance monitor has been introduced, combining the performance monitors of all subaccounts with traffic. For more information, see Performance Monitor.  You can now configure the file size of scc_core traces within the administration UI. For more information, see Log and Trace Settings.  Information about the last usage for each subject pattern rule now lets you identify whether a rule is still used regularly. For more information, see Configure Subject Patterns for Principal Propagation.  You can now configure a fadeout time for service channels in high availability (HA) setups. Thus, connections are not terminated immediately when switching roles intentionally, allowing a smoother transition to the new master instance. For more information, see Take-Over Settings.  Certificate-based authentication to the administration UI and REST APIs can now be configured to fallback to user/password authentication if a certificate is not available. For more information, see Additional administration REST APIs have been added for trace configuration, audit log configuration, and a v2 API to also allow the configuration of more than a single LDAP system.
