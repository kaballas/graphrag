Title: Reminder: Additional NAT IP Range Added to Amazon Web Services Region us10
Description: On June 26, 2025, SAP announced that an additional NAT IP address range (18.97.36.224/27) was added to the SAP BTP region us10 â€“ US East (VA) running on AWS. This is a reminder that the range will start to be used from October 8, 2025.   Actions:      If your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules, please adapt your configuration before October 8, 2025 by allowlisting the specified NAT IP address range.   Remove the following IP ranges from allowlisting between October 20, 2025 and October 24, 2025 if your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules. This is necessary because these IP ranges will be released from SAP and returned to AWS for redistribution, which changes their availability. Removing these ranges helps prevent unauthorized access to your environments by other AWS clients.       IPs to remove from allowlist:    52.23.189.23      52.23.1.211      52.4.101.240      18.204.173.15      18.210.47.160      18.211.235.11      184.73.43.82      3.213.197.54      3.216.16.207      3.88.250.160      34.192.100.96      34.192.134.47      34.202.136.35      34.225.190.250      34.234.191.59      35.153.88.132      52.2.110.230      52.20.242.182      52.200.165.163      52.204.111.138      52.71.83.110      54.156.172.106      54.205.71.200      54.208.119.130      54.221.30.91      54.234.93.200      54.85.65.82      For additional reference, see the list of IPs in Regions and API Endpoints for the Cloud Foundry Environment. The changes described above will be reflected in the list on October 9, 2025.
