Title: API Gateway module: Update to version 3.1.1
Description: Release 3.1.0 of the API Gateway module changes the stored version of APIRule to v2alpha1. This change is part of the migration process towards the v2 version, which will eventually result in removing the v1beta1 version.   This releases also contains the following improvements:    We've fixed behavior of in-cluster connectivity when using JWT handler in APIRule. Now, in-cluster connectivity is blocked.   We've fixed the extAuth handler not being scoped to a particular host.  We've fixed reconciliation of convertible APIRules.  When converting APIRule to version v2, the original-version annotation is not set if it's already present in the APIRule.  The order of rules in the APIRule Custom Resource is important. Rules defined earlier in the list have a higher priority than those defined later. For more information, see Significance of Rule Path Order.
