Title: Deprecation of Weak Client Certificate Chains
Description: This is a reminder that, as announced in May 2023 and on November 2, 2023, we plan to harden the security standards on certain properties for client certificates and their certificate chains in early 2024 to further strengthen platform security.   We are doing so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  While the change has already been rolled out on the regions br10 and eu20 in November 2023, the remaining regions are scheduled to follow on February 22, 2024.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates/mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  Action:  If you are using client certificates/mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command: openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see 3333978 .  If your certificate fails the verification, please contact the issuer of the certificate with the command you executed and the output you got and request a certificate that passes the verification.

Title: New Quick Action for Global Account Administrators to Assign Themselves as Subaccount Administrators in the Account Explorer
Description: If you're a global account administrator, you can now easily assign yourself as an administrator of any subaccount in your account structure. Go to the Account Explorer page in the SAP BTP cockpit and look for the new Add Me as Admin option in the    (Actions) context menu of the listed subaccounts.  This feature is especially useful if a previous subaccount administrator has left your organization. As a global account admin, you can quickly assign yourself and take over administrator duties, and add other subaccount members.  Action:  By default, this feature is available for all global accounts. If you want to disable it for your global account, send an opt-out request using the component BC-NEO-CIS-OPS and state your global account ID. See Getting Support for information about opening a case and getting technical assistance.

Title: Management of API Credentials for Calling REST APIs of SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service
Description: We’ve added a new way to manage technical credentials for REST APIs of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service. It's no longer restricted to multi-environment subaccounts with a Cloud Foundry environment, but works independently from environments in any multi-environment subaccount, directory, and global account. Most importantly, you can now also provision global account and directory members using the SCIM API. See Accessing Administration Using APIs of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service.

Title: Declaring System APIs and Events as Dependencies for Business Scenarios
Description: For certain formation types, systems of type Other System Type that are part of the System Landscape page may need to describe their runtime dependencies so other systems can comply with these dependencies to be able to interact with these systems in a common scenario.  The integration dependency includes a list of requirements, which point out which API and event resources are involved. Each requirement describes one aspect and can be used to express alternatives using OR conditions for achieving the same outcome.
