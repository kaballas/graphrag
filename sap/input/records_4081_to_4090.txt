Title: Root Certificate Replacement
Description: DigiCert has deprecated their DigiCert Global Root CA and will stop issuing certificates for SAP under any of its Intermediate CAs (ICA) at the end of 2023. For more information, see DigiCert root and intermediate CA certificate updates 2023.  SAP Cloud Identity Services switches to the G2 ICA and will deploy certificates signed by the new CA for the domains listed below starting in mid-November 2023. This means that the DigiCert Root CA domain certificate will be signed by DigiCert Global Root G2 instead of DigiCert Global Root CA. The following domains are affected:    *.accounts.ondemand.com      *.accounts.cloud.sap      *.accounts.sapcloud.cn      *.trial-accounts.ondemand.com      Action: If your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenants are running on any of the affected domains, ensure that you trust the new root CA: DigiCert Global Root G2.

Title: Deprecation of Weak Client Certificate Chains
Description: This is a reminder that, as originally announced on May 18, 2023, we plan to harden the security standards on certain properties for client certificates and their certificate chains in November 2023 to further strengthen platform security.   We will do so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openssl.org%2Fdocs%2Fman3.0%2Fman3%2FSSL_CTX_set_security_level.html%23DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  The change will be rolled out gradually, starting with the region br10 on November 29 and the region eu20 on November 30, 2023. All other regions are planned to be updated in January 2024. Further details regarding the timelines for the remaining regions will be announced through this channel in a timely manner.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates / mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  If you are using client certificates / mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command:openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see SAP Note 3333978 .  Action:  Please contact the issuer of the certificate with the command you executed and the output you got and request a certificate that passes the verification.
