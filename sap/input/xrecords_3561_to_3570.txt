Title: Serverless module: Update to version 1.3.0
Description: We are excited to announce the release of the Serverless module 1.3.0. This version includes improved resiliency and introduces a fully declarative mode for defining Functions by removing the Serverless admission webhook workload and embedding the x-kubernetes-validations rules into the Function Custom Resource Definition. We have also fixed a bug causing out-of-memory errors during the creation of large Functions and prevented caching of arbitrary Secrets & ConfigMaps to avoid controller crashes. In addition, trace span names are now preserved for the same Function's generations to ensure easy observability.
