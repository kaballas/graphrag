Component: Pricing Service
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Normalized Rate â€“ Treatment of Item Quantity Zero
Description: The normalized condition rate, which is the condition rate converted into the sales unit of measure and the document currency, cannot be calculated for an item quantity 0 and used to be returned as a null value, which caused errors in SAP CPQ. This issue has been corrected by skipping the conversion into the sales unit of measure and just converting the condition rate into the document currency if the item quantity is 0.
