Title: Istio module: Update to version 1.16.0
Description: Now, if you use the AWS provider, you can change the load balancer type from Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to Network Load Balancer (NLB) for Istio Ingress Gateway.  Prior to version 1.16, the Istio module used ELB as the load balancer type for the Istio Ingress Gateway. Starting with version 1.16.0, NLB is used as the new default.   Recommended action: It is recommended that you migrate from ELB to NLB if you use the Istio module running on AWS. To do this, remove the elb-deprecated ConfigMap from the istio-system namespace.Caution  Changing the load balancer type may cause brief downtime for Istio Ingress Gateway. Therefore, ensure you plan the migration process carefully, scheduling it during a maintenance window that minimizes the impact on the application's availability. The migration process from ELB to NLB is irreversible.For more information, see the migration guide.
