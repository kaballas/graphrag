Title: Elastic Scaling of Application Servers
Description: Via the elastic scaling feature, a system will scale dynamically by adding additional application servers when the system load increases. When the load decreases again, the system scales down. Scaling happens up to a system-specific maximum ACU value. Charges will relate to the actual allocated ABAP compute units.
