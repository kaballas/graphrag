Title: Commercial Information in SAP BTP Cockpit "Entitlements" Pages
Description: We're excited to announce a new enhancement to the SAP BTP cockpit that improves commercial transparency in the Entitlements pages in SAP BTP cockpit. With this enhancement, we've added entitlement source information, which displays how each entitled plan was added to your global account. This addition allows global account admins and viewers to gain a better understanding of the relationship between contractual service entitlements and the technical assets (services and plans) in your global account. This functionality is highly valuable, for example, if your account has multiple subscriptions from different packages for the same service plan, or your global account is entitled to service plans that are derived from both the subscription-based and consumption-based models.  Here's what you can expect:      Entitlements  Service Assignments page: Look for the Show commercial info toggle button. By turning on this option, you will see these new commercially-oriented columns added to the main table: Entitlement Source, Licensed Quantity, and Commercial Type.      Entitlements  Entity Assignments page:    Find the new View Commercial Info tab, which provides comprehensive commercial information.      Add Service Plans toggle button. By turning on this dialog box: Each service plan now includes an expandable Entitlements Sources section. This feature is accessible when configuring your assignments in the Manage Assignments view.          Additionally, we've introduced an Entitlement Source filter in both pages, allowing you to easily list plans based on their source of entitlement.   Note that this commercial information is not available for trial accounts.  See Managing Entitlements and Quotas Using the Cockpit, Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Directories, and Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Subaccounts.

Title: Contract-to-Billing Traceability Enhancements in SAP BTP Cockpit
Description: The Usage Analytics page in SAP BTP cockpit has been replaced with a new page called Costs and Usage. The new page offers a new look and exciting capabilities focusing on enhancing the cost transparency of the service consumption in your global account. All the features in the old Usage Analytics page are still available in the new page but may work a little differently now.  These are the new capabilities you can expect:      Billing Verification: Verify billing accurately using data and terminology incorporated from your monthly balance statement.      Cross Charging Analysis: Easily track and manage costs in your account hierarchy through search and filter options based on labels.      Advanced Usage and Cost Monitoring: Compare usage and costs for multiple services, see trends, and drill into subaccounts for more details.      Direct Access to Filtered Views: Bookmark your filters and search queries for quicker direct access and easier sharing with colleagues.      Note that if your global account has only a subscription-based commercial agreement, then the new page is called Usage. This page doesn't show billing data nor the new billing-related features that are described above.  See Monitoring Usage and Consumption Costs in Your Global Account and the Enhancing Costs, Usage and Contract Transparency blog.

Title: Usability Enhancements Added to SAP BTP Cockpit "Entitlements" Pages
Description: We've made several improvements to the Entitlements  Entity Assignments and Entitlements  Service Assignments in SAP BTP cockpit to enhance usability when managing service assignments in your global account.      Changed layout in Entity Assignments page: The Entity Assignments page now offers two views (tabs):      Manage Assignments: This is where global account admins can distribute the entitled service plans of their global account to subaccounts and directories. The functionality remains the same as before, except for the Configure Entitlements button that has been renamed to Edit.    View Commercial Information: This new tab allows global account admins and viewers to view the commercial source of their entitlements. This feature is not available for trial accounts.        Changed layout in Service Assignments page: The Service Overview option has been moved out of the Service dropdown menu and now has its own All Services view (tab) in the Service Assignments page. As a result, the Service Assignments page now has two views (tabs):      All Services: Provides an overview of all available service entitlements of your global account.      Assignments by Service: Allows you to choose specific services and see how their service plans are assigned to subaccounts and directories within your global account.          Improved visibility of free service plans: When configuring assignments in the Entity Assignments page, the Add Service Plans dialog box now displays the "Always Free" and "Free Tier" labels for service plans falling into these categories. This enhancement allows you to easily identify which plans are not charged for consumption.      Enhanced Service Assignments page: In the Service Assignments page, under the All Services view, we have added a new column called Assigned To. It shows you the total number of directories and subaccounts to which each service plan is assigned in your global account. You can click on the links in this column to quickly navigate to the selected service view and display more details about these assignments.      Access to service-related links: Documentation links, support info links, and SAP Discovery Center links, have been added when available. These links can be accessed in the Add Service Plans dialog box in the Entity Assignments page and in the main table of both Entitlements pages by clicking on the new    (Service Details) icon for any service listed under the Service Technical Name column.      Improved search functionality: In both Entitlements pages, the Search field has been relocated to the top of the page. You can now search for more than one term. Also, when you start typing, you get a list of suggestions. This change makes it more convenient for you to quickly search for specific entitlements or services.      New Plan Display Name column: We've added a new Plan Display Name column to both Entitlements pages. By default, this column is hidden, but you can choose to display it if needed.      See Managing Entitlements and Quotas Using the Cockpit, Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Directories, and Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Subaccounts.
