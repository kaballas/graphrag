Title: Improved Filter Management in Cockpit "Costs and Usage" Page
Description: We've improved the SAP BTP cockpit's Costs and Usage page by merging the filters and search that were previously available under the Billing and Usage views. Now, you'll find a single set of filters and search above the tabs that functions for both views. This enhancement eliminates the need to redefine the filters and search criteria separately for each view, making your experience more efficient and user-friendly.  See Monitoring Usage and Consumption Costs in Your Global Account.
