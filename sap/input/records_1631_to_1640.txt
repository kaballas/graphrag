Title: Pre-Production - Base Calculations Include Current Percentage Step
Description: In scenarios where a percentage condition spans multiple counters within the same step range in the pricing procedure, the condition base used not to be dynamically adjusted to account for the cumulative effect of prior conditions. Instead, all counters for the condition type used to use the original base amount. This issue has been corrected.

Title: Pre-Production – Consider Condition Record Descriptions
Description: For certain back-end releases it is possible to maintain a description on the condition record level that is then displayed in the pricing results instead of the condition type description. This applies only to non-variant conditions. The Pricing service supports the same mechanism. The feature will only be activated on request through a customer ticket on component LOD-CPS-PRC.

Title: Pre-Production – Correct Exchange Rate Type in Currency Conversion Trace
Description: The engine trace used to show an exchange rate type different from the one that was used during price calculation. For example, when the local currency is EUR and the document currency is USD, if the exchange rate type passed is M, but an alternative exchange rate type EURX is maintained in the customizing, the exchange rate is determined based on the alternative type. However, the currency conversion trace did not use to reflect this correctly and displayed the originally passed exchange rate type, M. This discrepancy used to cause confusion during the analysis using the trace information. This issue has been corrected.

Title: Pre-Production – Document Pricing - Change the Source of a Pricing Document
Description: When creating a new pricing document with endpoint POST /documents, the owner or source of the document can be specified by providing the following data: The source application, the source type; for example quote, and the source id; for example quote number 49709821. That source information is stored with the pricing document.  The source information can be used as a filter criteria in the APIs to manage stored pricing documents.  New: the enhanced endpoint PATCH /documents  allows overwriting the source of a pricing document if needed.   See: API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
