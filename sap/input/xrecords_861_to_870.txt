Title: Removal of SAP Java Buildpack 1
Description: SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and will be removed from SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment on June 30, 2025. As a consequence, deployments of MTAs containing modules of type java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee might start to fail, as the buildpack used by default is SAP Java Buildpack 1.   To ensure compliance with this change, starting from the beginning of July, the MTA deployment will switch the default value for the buildpack parameter from sap_java_buildpack (SAP Java Buildpack 1) to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta (SAP Java Buildpack 2).  Action:  Plan and migrate your applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2 ahead of the scheduled change. In your deployment descriptors, you need to explicitly set one of the parameters buildpack or buildpacks of the java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee modules to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta. Note that this transition involves more than just configuration updates and may require code modifications.  See:  Migrate your Applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2  SAP Java Buildpack 2: Jakarta-Based, Fresh and New!  TomEE 10 has landed in SAP Java Buildpack 2!
