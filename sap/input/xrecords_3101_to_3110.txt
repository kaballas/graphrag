Title: CSRF Protection for Dynamic Destinations
Description: Today our approuters do not provide CSRF protection for dynamic destinations. It’s assumed that backends behind the destinations, handle CSRF protection on their own.   New security measures have been introduced to enable CSRF protection by the approuter. This is done by setting the CEP.EnableCsrfProtection property to true for all dynamic destinations where their respective backend doesn’t handle CSRF protection.  If your backend is already protected, there’s no need to add this property.
