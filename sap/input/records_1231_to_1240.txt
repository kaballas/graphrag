Component: Kyma Runtime
Environment: Kyma
Title: Telemetry module: Update to version 1.35.0
Description: The new version brings the following improvements:      Traces and Metrics: Update to OTel Collector 0.120.0 (#1873).  With this update, the internal metrics of the collector have been aligned with the Prometheus conventions: The naming of the metrics was adjusted with suffixes and units, and instrumentation scopes have been added. This change does not have any impact on the health monitoring of the Telemetry module.  Recommended Action: If you are accessing the internal metrics endpoints directly, you must adapt your approach. If you cannot adapt right away, use the temporary annotation telemetry.kyma-project.io/internal-metrics-compatibility-mode: true - for details, see Telemetry CRD: Annotations.      Logs: Update to Fluent Bit 3.2.7 (#1876).
