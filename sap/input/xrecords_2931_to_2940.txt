Title: Async Loading Enabled by Default
Description: In March 2023, a new async loading setting was introduced to enhance site security by using a stricter policy and improving performance. It was recommended that you switch to this mode to ensure the proper rendering of your custom apps and plugins.  As of May 16th, 2024, asynchronous loading will be enabled by default for new sites. Therefore, please make sure to test your applications in asynchronous mode to see if any adaptations need to be made and make sure they're not using 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline' directives.

Title: Java Connector 3.1.9.0 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Java Connector (JCo) version 3.1.9.0 provides the following bug fixes:      Setting numeric string values into fields of type BCD with method JCoRecord.setValue([name|index], String) resulted in a ConversionException if the numeric string used scientific notation with an exponent. The same ConversionException occurred when deserializing such strings for field type BCD from JSON input data via method JCoRecord.fromJSON([Reader|String]).    Setting decimal number values into fields of type BCD with method JCoRecord.setValue([name|index], BigDecimal) did not throw a ConversionException if the fraction part of the provided java.math.BigDecimal value had too many digits to fully fit into the BCD field. The BigDecimal value was rounded and stored in the BCD field nevertheless. Thus, the provided value's precision was lost unnoticed.      If a JCoFunction uses a TABLES parameter with compatibly-extended metadata having appended additional columns compared to the parameter metadata used on RFC communication partner side, the first additional field of each transferred row could contain NULL-bytes and/or garbage characters. The occurrence of this program error depended on the table row's field structure and whether alignment bytes are required for internally organizing the table content data or not.        These issues have been fixed.

Title: Java Connector 3.1.9.0 - Enhancements
Description: Release of Java Connector (JCo) version 3.1.9.0 provides the following enhancements:      JCo 3.1.9.0 now requires the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015-2022 C/C++ runtime libraries to be installed on the system. This is relevant when using the SAP BTP SDK for the Neo environment on Windows operating systems.    JCo 3.1.9.0 now supports SapMachine 21.      WebSocket RFC client communication has been improved by adding a ping/pong packet exchange mechanism for keeping WebSocket RFC connections alive while waiting for an RFC response from the communication partner. Hence, an underlying TCP/IP network connection should not get closed anymore by firewalls or other network devices due to a potential network traffic idle timeout while waiting for long running requests being processed on the WebSocket RFC communication partner server side.  Corresponding ping periods and pong timeouts are configurable.   Find more details about the new properties jco.destination.ws_ping_period and jco.destination.ws_pong_timeout in Target System Configuration (Neo environment).
