Title: New HTTP Header for mTLS Authentication
Description: We added a new HTTP header X-SSL-Client-Root-CA-DN for all requests to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime that include optional or required client certificate authentication via mutual TLS (mTLS). You can use the new HTTP header to identify the root certificate authority (CA) at the top of the public key infrastructure hierarchy with the CA that signed the client certificate.  Action:  Check whether the total amount of HTTP headers in each of your requests is still under the limit of 101 (see SAP BTP-Specific Configurations), considering that the platform now takes up an additional HTTP header.  For general information about HTTP headers that the platform uses for mTLS authentication, see SAP Note 3472521 .
