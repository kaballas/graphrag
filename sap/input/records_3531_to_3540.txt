Title: Closing Structure Table Changed
Description: A second tab has been added to the Closing Structure table. While the Hierarchy tab displays the closing structure as a hierarchy - that is, the way you already know it - the new List tab shows the folders in a list.  This change affects the personalized views (formerly known as view variants) that you have created for the Closing Structure table. The existing views have been removed with this release and need to be recreated as required.  Note  Views are managed separately on both tabs. This means that you can create views specific to one of the tabs without the view appearing in your view management on the other tab.  App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: Recreate and save the views as required. To do this, go to the Closing Structure table in the Manage Closing Task Lists app, adjust the view as needed, and save it.
