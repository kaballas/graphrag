Title: UX Improvements to Page Editor
Description: The following enhancements have been made to the workpage editor:    A clearer distinction between the workpage layout elements (sections, columns, cells), and the content (tiles, cards, widgets).      A cleaner look and feel – only when hovering a section/cell/widget, the relevant settings and borders of that element are displayed.       When adding content to a workpage, there is a separation between tiles and card/widgets. If a certain cell is already populated with one type of content, the content finder will allow the user to select and add only the same type of content to this cell.      Removing the last content item in a cell will directly remove the column that contains this cell.
