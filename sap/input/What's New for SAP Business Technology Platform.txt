"Platform Domains";"Neo";"Root Certificate Replacement";"To remain compliant with modern security standards while maintaining continuous compatibility with all major browsers and platforms, the SAP BTP Neo environment will switch to the G3 ICA and deploy certificates signed by the new CA for all platform domains. This means that the DigiCert Root CA platform domain certificate will be signed by DigiCert Global Root G3 instead of DigiCert Global Root G2.   The switch will happen in individual regions starting as of April 2026.  The following platform domains are affected:    *.<Region.Domain>      *.dispatcher.<Region.Domain>      *.cert.<Region.Domain>      *.static.<Region.Domain>      *.vms.<Region.Domain>      *.netweaver.ondemand.com      connectivitynotification.<Region.Domain>      connectivitytunnel.<Region.Domain>      If you control the trust stores of your client, you must ensure that the new root CA is added to the certificate trust store. The client must include the old and the new root CA.   For an overview of all region domains, see: Regions and Hosts Available for the Neo Environment    Action: It is possible that older clients or operating systems do not trust the new root CA, which can cause certificate validation or handshake errors.

To achieve this we already switched from daily indexes to the index rollover approach (see previous announcement from 17. April 2025 for non OpenTelemetry workload indexes.This announcement deals with OpenTelemetry logs and metrics indexes (logs-otel-v1-, metrics-otel-v1-) targeting the release date - 29./30. October 2025.   With this change OpenTelemetry logs and metrics index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-2025.07.14), but a six-digit number suffix (e.g., metrics-otel-v1-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you are using the OpenTelemetry logs/metrics feature and rely on the old index suffix on your custom OpenSearch content / queries. In such cases you need to adapt:  Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.    If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern (e.g. metrics-otel-v1-*) instead of targeting individual indexes.      Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.    ";"Required";"General Availability";"Announcement";"Technology";"2025-10-29";"2025-10-29";"Cloud"
"Kyma Runtime";"Kyma";"Native sidecars enabled by default with Istio module 1.22";"With version 1.27, Istio changed the default behavior of attaching Istio sidecar proxy containers, which now run as native sidecars. This approach resolves network connection issues that arise when regular Istio sidecar proxy containers are not ready at the same time as application containers or init containers. Additionally, regular sidecar containers prevent Pods from finishing, for example, in the case of Jobs. If you use the Kubernetes API, an istio-proxy container running as a native sidecar appears in the initContainers list instead of the containers list in a Pod's spec. To learn more, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  To allow more time for Kyma runtime users to adjust to this change, the Istio module in version 1.21 disables the default use of native sidecars. Although Istio module 1.21 installs Istio updated to version 1.27, by default, Istio sidecar proxies are still deployed as regular sidecar containers. With version 1.22 of the Istio module, Istio proxy sidecars will be deployed by default as native sidecars.   The Istio module 1.22 is scheduled to be rolled out to the fast channel on October 8, 2025, and to the regular channel on October 22, 2025.   To use native sidecars before the Istio module 1.22 is released, you must annotate specific Pods or Pod templates with the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: ""true"".  To continue using regular sidecars instead of native sidecars after the Istio module 1.22 is released, choose one of these solutions:  Disable the use of native sidecars for a particular workload by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to ""false"" on a Pod or in the Pod template.  Disable the feature globally for all workloads by setting the compatibilityMode field in the Istio CR to true. See Compatibility Mode.  Required action: Test how your application and the tooling (such as automations or monitoring) behave when the Istio sidecar proxy runs as a native sidecar by setting the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to ""true"" for all your workloads. This is especially important if you have implemented any workarounds for problems caused by the Istio sidecar proxies' lifecycle or if you use automation or monitoring tools to observe the istio-proxy containers. If everything works fine, you can:  Leave the annotation sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar: ""true"", so that you immediately benefit from native sidecar functionality regardless of the Istio module's upgrades.  Remove the annotation and rely on the default settings.  In case of issues, you can explicitly set the sidecar.istio.io/nativeSidecar annotation to ""false"" to use regular sidecar containers until you fix the problem. This guarantees that nothing will change when native sidecars are enabled by default by the Istio module 1.22.";"Required";"Deprecated";"Changed";"Technology";"2025-09-05";"2025-10-22";"Cloud"

To learn about new features, bug fixes, and changes in this release, read the Istio 1.27 release announcement and Upgrade Notes.Caution  Since version 1.27, Istio injects the Istio proxy as an init container by default. In this release, the Istio module's operator disables this behavior to maintain compatibility. Disabling this behavior is a temporary measure and will be removed with Istio module 1.22. After this, sidecar proxies will be injected as init containers by default. For more information, see Istio Proxy as Native Sidecar Container.  The Istio module now supports installation with Istio images injected into the installer from environment variables. This allows for more flexible deployments, especially in environments where images are not available in a public registry. See issue #1519.  Additionally, this release contains the following bug fixes:  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.  We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled. See issue #1523.  We've fixed a bug where the app.kubernetes.io/version label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources. See issue #1523.

This is a reminder that the range will start to be used from October 8, 2025.   Actions:      If your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules, please adapt your configuration before October 8, 2025 by allowlisting the specified NAT IP address range.   Remove the following IP ranges from allowlisting between October 20, 2025 and October 24, 2025 if your Cloud Foundry applications connect to systems that restrict access by allowlisting IPs in firewall rules.

"Multitarget Applications for Cloud Foundry";"Cloud Foundry";"Introduction of a new top-level parameter region-domain";"A new top-level parameter region-domain is introduced. It is resolved to the domain of the current region. (See the Domain column in Regions and API Endpoints Available for the Cloud Foundry Environment). When a region has multiple CF API endpoints, the parameter will point to the domain of the respective endpoint used for the deployment. The parameter is different from the existing parameters default-domain and region-primary-domain:      The parameter default-domain usually depends on the current organization setup and the existing shared domains for it. It is not reliable for regions without shared domains, for example regions China (Shanghai) and China (North 3). On the other hand, the region-domain parameter is more sustainable and does not depend on the current organization setup.  The parameters region-primary-domain and region-domain are equal when used in most of the regions. They are different when MTA deployments are done in target org/space in different CF APIs in one region.      Examples:  If the MTA deployment is done in a target org/space with CF API endpoint that is equal to api.eu10.hana.ondemand.com, the value of the domain would be:    default-domain: cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com      region-domain: eu10.hana.ondemand.com      region-primary-domain: eu10.hana.ondemand.com      If the MTA deployment is done in a target org/space with CF API endpoint that is equal to api.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com, the value of the domain would be:    default-domain: cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com      region-domain: eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com      region-primary-domain: eu10.hana.ondemand.com      See Parameters and Properties.";"Info only";"General Availability";"New";"Technology";"2025-09-18";"2025-09-18";"2509a"

In buildless mode, Function code and dependencies are injected directly into Kyma-provided runtime images at Pod startup.  You can toggle on or off buildless mode by changing the Serverless configuration and choosing the best approach for your use case. For more details, see Serverless Buildless Mode.  Starting with the 1.9.0 release, buildless mode will be switched on by default, with the option to disable it manually. From the 2.0.0 version, buildless mode will be the only available option.  Localizable Serverless Images:Serverless runtime images can now be localized, enabling deployment in environments with restricted or private registries.  This enhancement improves flexibility and compliance for enterprise and regulated workloads.  Dedicated Network Policies:With version 1.8.0, users can enable dedicated Serverless network policies. This ensures Serverless remains functional on clusters with restrictive, deny-all network policies, improving security and compatibility for enterprise environments.  Deprecations/Breaking changes:The following fields, that were deprecated in the Serverless 1.6.0 release are no longer functional in buildless mode:    Function CRD  spec.scaleConfig – For existing Functions with scaleConfig defined, the HorizontalPodAutoscaler objects are not deleted upon switching to buildless mode, but are no longer managed by the Serverless module.

In addition to the default Istio containers, the module also restarts native sidecar init containers. However, configuring native sidecars directly from the Istio Custom Resource (CR) is not supported. For more information, see issue #1426.Caution  If your cluster's Istio service mesh includes workloads with initContainer sidecars, the Istio module will restart these workloads for the first time. See Restart of Workloads with Enabled Istio Sidecar Injection, Istio sidecar documentation, and Kubernetes Native Sidecars in Istio.    We've updated the Istio version to 1.26.2. For more information, read the Istio 1.26.2 release announcement and Istio 1.26.0 release announcement.  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.  We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled.  We've fixed a bug where the app.kubernetes.io/version label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources.

A cause exception similar to Caused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: class com.sap.scc.util.LogUtils (in unnamed module @0x2d019f4f) cannot access class sun.security.validator.ValidatorException (in module java.base) can no longer occur, when running the Cloud Connector with SapMachine 11, 17, or 21.  In a shadow instance, the message ""LDAP changes will not take effect unless Cloud Connector is restarted"" will now be shown only if the LDAP configuration has indeed been changed.  After an upgrade of an instance using both, a separate HA (high availability) port and multiple LDAP instances, the LDAP configuration did not work anymore. The previous configuration got corrupted and as a consequence, the trace was wrongly showing ""Unable to determine whether password should be changed for user sccadmin"".  Alerts about a successful switch of roles are now no longer popping up again after having deleted these alerts. This was a regression in 2.18.0.  The setting for user OID mapping for client certificate authentication did not survive a restart, it was stored and shown correctly in the UI. However, for the logon always ""CN"" was used again after a restart.  After an upgrade, an email configuration that used TLS, lost its TLS attribute. This was a regression in 2.18.0.  The upgrade now ignores corrupted zip files (for example, file size 0) in the log directory so the Cloud Connector can be started properly after an upgrade.

The value of the header is a single IP address which can be utilized for IP address-based request filtering on the application side, such as per-client rate limiting and allow- or blocklisting clients by their IP addresses.  The HTTP header can also be used in conjunction with a route service, as the original client IP address is preserved in this scenario.  The header value is logged with the same key name X-Cf-True-Client-Ip by Gorouter for all incoming requests, allowing filtering and charting RTR logs by the client IP address.";"Info only";"General Availability";"New";"Technology";"2025-05-15";"2025-05-15";"Cloud"

This version of Istio includes changes to compatibility version parameters. See the parameters of the previous compatibility version switched from false to true:  ENABLE_INBOUND_RETRY_POLICY: If true, enables retry policy for inbound routes, which automatically retries any requests that were reset before reaching the intended service.  EXCLUDE_UNSAFE_503_FROM_DEFAULT_RETRY: If true, excludes unsafe retry on 503 from the default retry policy.  PREFER_DESTINATIONRULE_TLS_FOR_EXTERNAL_SERVICES: If true, external services prefer the TLS settings from DestinationRules over the metadata TLS settings.  ENABLE_ENHANCED_DESTINATIONRULE_MERGE: If enabled, Istio merges DestinationRules based on their exportTo fields. The DestinationRules are then kept as independent rules if the exportTo fields are not equal.  PILOT_UNIFIED_SIDECAR_SCOPE: If true, unified SidecarScope creation is used. This is only intended as a temporary feature flag for backward compatibility.  ENABLE_DEFERRED_STATS_CREATION: If enabled, Istio lazily initializes a subset of the stats.  BYPASS_OVERLOAD_MANAGER_FOR_STATIC_LISTENERS: If enabled, the overload manager is not applied to static listeners.    This compatibility version applies the following new parameter set to false:   PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE: If enabled, the pilot starts a controller that assigns IP addresses to ServiceEntry that do not have a user-supplied IP. When combined with DNS capture, this allows TCP routing of traffic sent to the ServiceEntry.    Note the significant changes announce with release 1.25.1 of Istio:   ISTIO_META_DNS_AUTO_ALLOCATE in proxyMetadata has been deprecated in favor of a newer version of DNS auto-allocation.  traffic.sidecar.istio.io/kubevirtInterfaces has been deprecated in favor of istio.io/reroute-virtual-interfaces.

The overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters will be improved by proper index sizing, especially in high-ingest and huge storage volume scenarios. To achieve this, we will switch from daily indexes to the index rollover approach targeting the updated release date - 17. April 2025.  With this change, the index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., logs-json-2024.11.19), but a six-digit number (e.g., logs-json-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you run queries against the old index suffix. In such cases you need to adapt:      Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.          If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern instead of targeting individual indexes.          Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.      This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.";"Required";"General Availability";"Announcement";"Technology";"2025-02-10";"2025-04-17";"Cloud"

Prior to version 1.16, the Istio module used ELB as the load balancer type for the Istio Ingress Gateway. Starting with version 1.16.0, NLB is used as the new default.   Recommended action: It is recommended that you migrate from ELB to NLB if you use the Istio module running on AWS. To do this, remove the elb-deprecated ConfigMap from the istio-system namespace.Caution  Changing the load balancer type may cause brief downtime for Istio Ingress Gateway.

Background and Motivation:  SAP Java Buildpack 2 is generally available (GA) since March 2024 and provides support for the latest and greatest versions of Java (17 and 21), Tomcat (10.1), and TomEE (10.0).  SAP Java Buildpack 1, on the other hand, supports older versions of Java (8, 11), Tomcat 9, an SAP-patched version of TomEE 7 (which reached EoL in March 2021), and SapMachine 11 (which also reached EoL in December 2024).  Our goal is to focus our efforts on delivering highly-requested new features, reducing technical debt, and boosting product quality and security.  As a result, SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and will be removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment on June 30, 2025.   Action:    If you have applications running on sap_java_buildpack, you need to migrate them to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta as soon as possible.   To learn how, see: Migrate your Applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2  Timeline:  We plan to support SAP Java Buildpack 1 until June 30, 2025, and then it will be removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.  Applications that haven’t been migrated to SAP Java Buildpack 2 by then might continue to run but will fail if being restaged or redeployed.  In H1 of 2025, new releases of SAP Java Buildpack 1 will be only made for critical security updates and bug fixes.";"Required";"Deprecated";"Announcement";"Technology";"2025-04-03";"2025-04-03";"Cloud"

"Kyma Runtime";"Kyma";"Istio module: Update to version 1.15.0";"To collect custom metrics from a workload that exposes its metrics endpoint on the same port as its business API, you must use mTLS for scraping. While Kyma Telemetry supports this scenario, other observability tools rely on the prometheusMerge feature of Istio. Now, you can enable this feature by setting the config.telemetry.metrics.prometheusMerge field in the Istio custom resource (CR).  When enabled, the Istio sidecar running with an application exposes an additional port 15020.

The target audience of the change is developers:   If no credential types are defined in the service binding parameters, the Application Autoscaler service applies a default. This default will be changed to x509 (instead of binding-secret).   Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type"", ""x509""]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.   For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.

"Authorization and Trust Management Service";"ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Other";"Deprecation of SAML for User-Interactive Authentication in Customer-Owned Accounts";"This announcement is only for subaccount administrators managing business users in SAP BTP subaccounts.  SAML trust configurations are deprecated for user-interactive authentication in customer-owned accounts regardless of the specific identity provider. The CIO Guide: Identity Lifecycle in SAP Landscapes provides the guidance for this deprecation. We recommend a single trust configuration per subaccount with SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. This configuration enables direct usage of SAP Cloud Identity Services by applications and services, meaning without the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service. Such direct usage of SAP Cloud Identity Services is the recommended programming model for new applications and services.  The deprecation doesn't apply to the following cases:      Principal propagation using the SAML Bearer flow. An example for this is an SAML trust configuration to accept API calls on behalf of users from another subaccount using a destination.      Trust between a partner-owned subaccount and a customer-owned tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services. OIDC support for this constellation is planned, but isn't possible yet. Until then, use SAML and make sure the trusted identity provider is already SAP Cloud Identity Services and not any other identity provider.      Trust between your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant and your corporate identity provider.      Note  This announcement has no bearing on the use of SAML for other SAP products or other use cases within the SAP BTP family of solutions.   Existing SAML trust configurations affected by the deprecation will still be tolerated after the deprecation date and continue to work. Support will be restricted to security-related fixes.   Impact  When you create a new trust configuration for interactive login, choose a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services with the OIDC protocol. Use Establish Trust in the SAP BTP cockpit or the btp create security/trust command of the btp CLI. For more information, see the documentation about Establish Trust. If you have a corporate identity provider, use SAP Cloud Identity Services as a proxy and then connect corporate identity providers with SAML or OIDC.  We recommend migrating existing SAML trusts according to the documentation Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect Trust with SAP Cloud Identity Services, however this isn't mandatory until the deprecation date. The following cases are covered:        Trust to SAP Cloud Identity Services: A simple change of protocol.      Trust to another identity provider: SAP Cloud Identity Services is inserted as a proxy between the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service and your corporate identity provider.   Note  The restriction of a single Identity Authentication OIDC trust per subaccount also applies here.      ";"Info only";"Deprecated";"Changed";"Technology";"2025-05-28";"2024-12-31";"2412b"

This version includes changes to compatibility version parameters. See the parameters for the previous compatibility version switched from false to true:  ENABLE_DELIMITED_STATS_TAG_REGEX: If true, Istio Pilot uses the new delimited stat tag regex to generate Envoy stats' tags.  ENABLE_DEFERRED_CLUSTER_CREATION: If enabled, Istio creates clusters only when there are requests. This saves memory and CPU cycles in cases where there are lots of inactive clusters and more than one worker thread.  This compatibility version applies the following new parameters set tofalse:  ENABLE_INBOUND_RETRY_POLICY: If true, enables retry policy for inbound routes, which automatically retries any requests that were reset before reaching the intended service.  EXCLUDE_UNSAFE_503_FROM_DEFAULT_RETRY: If true, excludes unsafe retry on 503 from the default retry policy.  PREFER_DESTINATIONRULE_TLS_FOR_EXTERNAL_SERVICES: If true, external services prefer the TLS settings from DestinationRules over the metadata TLS settings.  ENABLE_ENHANCED_DESTINATIONRULE_MERGE: If enabled, Istio merges DestinationRules based on their exportTo fields. The DestinationRules are then kept as independent rules if the exportTo fields are not equal.  PILOT_UNIFIED_SIDECAR_SCOPE: If true, unified SidecarScope creation is used. This is only intended as a temporary feature flag for backward compatibility.  ENABLE_DEFERRED_STATS_CREATION: If enabled, Istio lazily initializes a subset of the stats.  BYPASS_OVERLOAD_MANAGER_FOR_STATIC_LISTENERS: If enabled, the overload manager is not applied to static listeners.

To achieve this we will switch from daily indexes to the index rollover approach targeting the 2501a release (RTC 06.02.25)   With this change, the index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., logs-json-2024.11.19), but a six-digit number (e.g. logs-json-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  This should not affect most use cases, but if there is strict a dependency on the date suffix in the index name format, this needs to be adapted.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC).

This change conforms with the new defaults of the Cloud Foundry command line interface (see https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/v8.html), which come with cf CLI v8.

The change only affects you if the following prerequisite is true:        The xsenableasyncservice attribute is not configured in the application security descriptor.        If you are affected, ensure that your application works with asynchronous service instance creations and updates. This can easily be done by specifying the following attribute in the security descriptor before the change:  ""xsenableasyncservice"":""true""  It has the same effect as the planned change. Since asynchronous service instance creations and updates don't wait until the processing is finished, you may want to adapt the CF CLI commands in your deployment scripts so that they wait until completion:        cf create-service xsuaa application <service_instance> -c <security_descriptor_file> --wait      cf update-service <service_instance> -c <security_descriptor_file> --wait          Note  The --wait option is supported by Cloud Foundry CLI version 8 or higher.

This was caused by a changed default value introduced in Tomcat 9.0.90. With the upgrade to Tomcat 9.0.95, the problem has been solved. This was a regression in 2.17.1.  When upgrading a shadow instance, the master high availability (HA) port got lost during the upgrade. This was a regression in 2.17.1.  Pressing CapsLock when entering a password into Cloud Connector's login screen deleted the password characters that were entered so far. This was caused by a regression in UI5 Core 1.108.30 that was used in 2.17.1.  In the connection monitor details view the active requests were not showing the user that is invoking the service, even if the user is actually known. This was a regression introduced in 2.16.0.  Due to a faulty consistency check, the custom regions list contained all the known regions that were in use on the Cloud Connector. This illegal state has been corrected.  When using a dedicated HA port and resetting the HA settings on a shadow, the shadow's UI port within the HA information was wrongly set to the HA port. As a consequence, after connecting again to a master, it was not possible to open the shadow UI using the button in the master UI in the High Availability screen.

The deprecation phase will start on October 28, 2024. APIRule v1beta1 version will be deleted on May 12, 2025. To make sure you can smoothly migrate your APIRule custom resources (CRs) to the stable version v2, you can start testing version v2alpha1 and provide feedback before the migration window opens. Version v2alpha1 is intended for testing purposes only, helping you evaluate the new version’s compatibility and functionality. It is not recommended for use in production environments. By testing APIRule v2alpha1 in advance and providing feedback, you can help us further refine this version, ensuring that the formal upgrade will have minimal impact on your operations. The migration process does not disturb any existing applications.   We expect version v2alpha1 to be promoted to version v2 without significant changes. The release of version v2 is planned for April 15, 2025. After that, you will be required to complete the migration from version v1beta1 to version v2 by May 12, 2025.  Recommended action: We strongly recommend that you test the migration process in a non-production environment using version v2alpha1. This will not only help you familiarize yourself with the new features but also allow us to optimize the migration experience and apply your feedback.  Required action: During the migration window lasting from April 15, 2025 until May 12, 2025, you must migrate your production APIRule CRs to version v2.

This increases the stability and reliability of the reconciliation for the Istio module's operator. See issue #155.  We've updated the Istio version to 1.23.2. Read the Istio 1.23.2 release announcement and Istio 1.23.0 Change Notes. Take note of the following breaking changes included in the new minor version of Istio:  Deferred cluster creation: In the context of Envoy, a cluster is a group of logically similar upstream hosts that Envoy connects to. Typically, clusters are defined and created at startup. This means that regardless of whether or not a cluster will be used during the lifetime of the Envoy process, it will still be initialized. Envoy has introduced a new optimization that allows these clusters to be created on the worker threads inline during requests, which can save memory and CPU cycles. If you rely on the old behavior, consider using the compatibility mode, which disables the deferred cluster creation feature by setting ENABLE_DEFERRED_CLUSTER_CREATION to false.  Updates to Envoy cluster metrics parsing: Previously, the Envoy cluster metrics for services that did not use the .svc.cluster.local suffix were incorrectly truncated and parsed. This was because Envoy cluster metrics use dots . as a delimiter between metric namespaces. It is impossible to properly distinguish between those delimiters and the dots in hostnames or cluster names. To address this, the regex for parsing cluster_name has been updated to look for a semicolon that indicates the end of a cluster's name. If you have any dependency on the full stat name for cluster metrics, you must update your monitoring system to account for this change. If you require more time to make adjustments, consider using the compatibility mode, which reverts this behavior by setting ENABLE_DELIMITED_STATS_TAG_REGEX to false.

The change is planned to be done in October 2024.  Currently, the service update is fail-safe, and even in the event of a failure, MTA deployment will proceed successfully. This behavior, however, is problematic as it conceals issues that may arise during MTA deployment, which are only detected at a later stage or even during runtime.  The behavior will be changed and MTA deployments will start to fail in case of service instance update failure.  Action:If a certain service instance should not impact the whole MTA deployment there are two options to proceed. Choose one depending on your needs:    Declare the MTA resource as optional – when making an MTA resource optional all operations related to it are fail-safe. It includes not only the service instance update but also service binding, unbinding, etc. The option is valuable for service instances that are optional during the runtime of your application;      Avoid service instance updates by providing parameter skip-service-updates – the option could be interpreted as “create-only” for the service instance. It is useful when a service instance needs to be created in the initial MTA deployment and not altered afterwards. The parameter skip-service-updates defines the different parts of the service instance that are to be omitted during update. See the example for skipping service updates.

"SAP Java Buildpack";"Cloud Foundry";"Deprecation of SAP Java Buildpack 1";"Please be aware that SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and is going to be removed from SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment in June 2025.  Background and Motivation:  SAP Java Buildpack 2 is generally available (GA) since early March 2024 and provides support for the latest and greatest versions of Java (17 and 21) and Tomcat (10.1). We also plan to support TomEE 10 as soon as it goes GA.  SAP Java Buildpack 1, on the other hand, supports older versions of Java (8, 11), Tomcat 9, and an SAP-patched version of TomEE 7 (which reached EoL in March 2021). SapMachine 11 will also reach EoL soon – in December 2024.  Our goal is to focus our efforts on delivering highly-requested new features, reducing technical debt, and boosting product quality and security.  As a result, SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and technical support for it will be provided until June 30, 2025.   Action:    If you have applications running on sap_java_buildpack, you need to migrate them to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta as soon as possible.   Note  If your applications depend on TomEE 7, don’t start the migration yet but wait until we announce the availability of TomEE 10 in SJB 2.  Migration:      If your applications are compiled with Java 8, they should run successfully on any later version as Java versions are backward compatible. The only exception would be if your apps are using internal or undocumented Java APIs that have been removed or changed. Otherwise, your applications should be running fine and no extra effort from your side is required. Still, we recommend that you thoroughly test your application scenarios with the new Java version (17 or 21).    If your application or its dependencies are using former Java EE javax.* packages, you need to migrate them to Jakarta EE jakarta.* ones. You can do that by using any of the community tools available to run the migration. For example:      https://github.com/apache/tomcat-jakartaee-migration      https://tomee.apache.org/javax-to-jakarta.html          If you have multi-target applications (MTA), you need to adjust all modules with the following types:      java      java.tomcat      java.tomee      Since MTA deployment descriptors currently use sap_java_buildpack as a default buildpack, you need to set the buildpack module parameter to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta. For example:  modules:   - name: myapp       type: java.tomcat       parameters:           buildpack: sap_java_buildpack_jakarta  For more information, see MTA Module Types and Module-Specific Parameters.      Timeline:  We plan to support SAP Java Buildpack 1 until June 30, 2025 when it will be removed from SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. Applications that haven’t been migrated to SAP Java Buildpack 2 by then might continue to run but will get an error when being restaged or redeployed.  In Q4 of 2024, we'll stop adding new features to SAP Java Buildpack 1, and will only provide security updates and bug fixes.   In H1 of 2025, new releases for SAP Java Buildpack 1 will be made only for critical security updates and bug fixes.";"Required";"Deprecated";"Announcement";"Technology";"2024-08-16";"2024-08-22";"Cloud"

The new version of the APIRule CRD is a significant step towards a stable API Gateway API.   Version v2alpha1 includes the following changes:  The APIRule authorization policy is now based solely on Istio and the APIRule CRD no longer supports the Ory Oathkeeper authorization policy.  Access strategies are now limited to jwt and noAuth, with plans to support extAuth in the future. You can find more information about the strategies in the access strategies documentation and the ADR for the extAuth access strategy.    Now, both versions of APIRule custom resources are supported. The APIRule CR in version v1beta1 will become deprecated in 2024 once we finish extending its configuration. Currently, we’re working on adding the extAuth access strategy, which might be a migration path for oauth2 handlers based on Ory Oathkeeper. When the time comes and we announce the deprecation, you'll see a What's New note with a detailed migration procedure. For now, we encourage you to learn more about the new version and follow the APIRule tutorials.  The new version is not backward compatible with v1beta1.  Besides that, this release includes the following changes:  Ory Oathkeeper's scaling is now based only on CPU utilization. This adjustment ensures that the scaling is more responsive to traffic changes, as Oathkeeper memory utilization is not a good indicator of the traffic load.

"Application Autoscaler";"Cloud Foundry";"End of support for the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme (basic auth) when using the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API for security reasons";"We are going to make the following change for security reasons. The target audience of the change is developers:   Until now, service bindings of the Application Autoscaler always provided url, username, and password in the credentials section. These credentials could be used to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using the “Basic” HTTP Authentication security scheme.  What changes  We are going to remove the support for “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme to access the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API.   To enable you to prepare and test this transition, we are introducing a new parameter credential-type, which can be used to proactively prepare for the removal.  Note  Alternatively, you have the option to change the behavior up to three months later.   If no credential types are defined in the service binding parameters, the Application Autoscaler service applies a default. This default is for now binding-secret.       When the credential-type binding-secret is chosen, url, username, and password will be provided in the credentials section.       When the credential-type x509 is chosen, url, username and password are not provided in the credentials section.       Regardless of which credential-type is active, it is always possible access to the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API using mTLS, see Defining a Custom Metric.  On 2025-01-22, we plan to change the credential-type default to x509, but you will still be able to explicitly specify the credential-type binding-secret.   Starting, 2025-04-30 only the credential-type x509 will be valid, either set explicitly, or by default, if not set explicitly.  Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       Or the credential-type parameter is set to binding-secret during the creation of the binding.      If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type"", ""x509""]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.

Istio Operator does not restart Pods with the Istio sidecar that contain custom image annotations. See Resource Annotations.  We've changed Istio Ingress Gateway's scaling to be based only on CPU utilization. This adjustment ensures that the scaling is more responsive to traffic changes, as the Istio Ingress Gateway memory utilization is not a good indicator of the traffic load.  The default number of Istio Ingress Gateway replicas in smaller clusters is now set to 1.  We've introduced the compatibility mode, which allows you to mitigate breaking changes when a new Istio module's release introduces an Istio upgrade.

Setting decimal number values into fields of type BCD with method JCoRecord.setValue([name|index], BigDecimal) did not throw a ConversionException if the fraction part of the provided java.math.BigDecimal value had too many digits to fully fit into the BCD field. The BigDecimal value was rounded and stored in the BCD field nevertheless. Thus, the provided value's precision was lost unnoticed.      If a JCoFunction uses a TABLES parameter with compatibly-extended metadata having appended additional columns compared to the parameter metadata used on RFC communication partner side, the first additional field of each transferred row could contain NULL-bytes and/or garbage characters.

"SAP Analytics Cloud";"Other";"Features for 2024 QRC 2 (version 2024.8)";"We are happy to inform you that with the release of SAP Analytics Cloud Q2 2024, all the supporting documentation is available on SAP Help Portal.    On the SAP Analytics Cloud product page, you’ll find a complete set of SAP Analytics Cloud guides and resources.  Some highlights include:   Stories improvements:  In the optimized story experience, the filter by member dialog has been redesigned and now provides new features:  Improved UI architecture: The UI layout of the member selector provides direct access to the essential actions and settings, such as the search field and the hierarchy selection. Other settings, like read mode or text presentation, have been moved into a settings panel that can be opened on demand. The multi-column presentation of the selectable members allows for better readability.  Increased flexibility: The dialog box can now be resized, and can be dragged to a different position. The panels are also resizable, and the content of the panels are fully responsive.   Continuous scrolling: The new member selector implements a lazy loading mechanism that applies to the list of selectable members as well as the list of member selections: as you scroll down, members are automatically and continuously loaded at the bottom.  Search hits highlighting: The new member selector bolds each part of a member label that matches the search criteria.  Enhanced search capabilities: The new member selector supports the wildcard search, specifically the wildcard character “*” which replaces zero or more characters.  Enhanced member exclusion paradigm: The new member selector introduces an advanced paradigm for member exclusion: it allows you to deselect one or more descendants of a selected node. For example, select the country “USA” but explicitly exclude the state “Florida”. This selection is dynamic, which means that if, in the data source, a new state is registered under the country “USA”, it is implicitly part of the selection.    In the optimized story experience, we now support model replacement.  Replacement within stories is done on a per model basis and will be limited to models that have the same data source type and same number and type of structure dimensions. The original model and replacement model do not need to share the same connection nor have the same number of objects (accounts, measures, dimensions, or properties). However, the version level of the system where the replacement model is located is meant to be the same or higher than that of the system on which the original model is located.  Some data models cannot be used as replacement models because their feature set is superseded by alternative models for which further new features are being developed. These types of models can only be used as original models and can be replaced by their designated alternative models. For example:  An SAP Datasphere Analytic Dataset can be replaced by an SAP Datasphere Analytic Model.  A Classic Model (Account Only) can be replaced by a New Model with accounts and measures.  A Public Dataset can be replaced by a New Model with measures (and no accounts).    In the optimized story experience, the displayed numeric values (and decimal places) will be based on the full precision (non-rounded) source value: this improves the precision of planning workflows that use these numbers. However, some numbers may not be displayed as expected and will require additional formatting.  As an application integration developer, you can call the SAP Analytics Cloud REST API by story ID and widget ID to access data from numeric points in optimized story experience. You can therefore consume the SAP Analytics Cloud widgets in SAP Mobile Start.   The following features are now supported in optimized story experience: section widget, batch export, export all table data to XLSX.  In optimized story experience, you can use composites on responsive pages in addition to canvas pages. In addition, you can replace models of a composite, or objects in use without replacing the model after adding it to your story.  As a story designer in optimized story experience, you can open the font scaling tool to set font scale for responsive pages or individual widgets for specific devices, so that the font sizes in your story are dynamically adapted to different devices.      Planning improvements:  In the advanced formulas of data actions, you can now use analytic models owned by SAP Analytics Cloud as source models.   When checking data changes in the analytic window during data action tracing, you can now enable Show Only Leaves for a dimension to only show its leaf members.  New Planning Trigger Styling Options: When using the optimized story experience, you can now set and save your default style preferences for your planning triggers in the Theme Preferences dialog. Additionally, you have the option to upload SVG files to use as the trigger button icon either in the Styling panel or the Theme Preferences dialog.  Prediction Interval in Multi Actions: In the predictive step of multi actions, when you choose either the Train and Forecast or Apply predictive action, you can now save a prediction interval by choosing a prediction interval minimum and a prediction interval maximum. Using this feature allows you to visualize the prediction quality.    Data Analyzer improvements:  In data analyzer you can now filter in the filterline on calculated measures you’ve created. After having created the calculated measures, they appear instantly in the list of measure options in the filterline.  As a user of the Calculated Measures dialog in data analyzer you can now find syntax highlighting in the formula editor. This adds clarity to the formula you create by differentiating objects like measures and functions, etc.  The Available Objects list and the Builder panel in data analyzer have been enhanced:  In the Available Objects list the sorting now works separately for either dimensions, measures or structures via the More (three dots) menu for the respective object type.   If your model contains a hierarchy, the hierarchy structure is now displayed in the Available Objects list and in the Builder panel.    If you export data as PDF file in data analyzer, you can now use the setting option Fit to page width which allows you to resize your table to fit the actual page width for the PDF export.  In data analyzer you can now open a model from SAP BW workspaces, save insights to workspaces and reopen them from a workspace. You can also open data analyzer from a chart or table in story that uses a model saved to a workspace.    Calendar improvements:  In both optimized story experience and analytics designer, you can use script APIs to create a calendar process, send an immediate reminder, update or reopen a calendar event, get more properties of it, and so on.   Administrators can now configure which in-app notifications or emails are sent to users who are involved in calendar events. They can define the settings depending on the users’ roles (owners, assignees/reviewers, or viewers). For details, see Emails and Notifications.

The same ConversionException occurred when deserializing such strings for field type BCD from JSON input data via method JCoRecord.fromJSON([Reader|String]).    Setting decimal number values into fields of type BCD with method JCoRecord.setValue([name|index], BigDecimal) did not throw a ConversionException if the fraction part of the provided java.math.BigDecimal value had too many digits to fully fit into the BCD field. The BigDecimal value was rounded and stored in the BCD field nevertheless. Thus, the provided value's precision was lost unnoticed.      If a JCoFunction uses a TABLES parameter with compatibly-extended metadata having appended additional columns compared to the parameter metadata used on RFC communication partner side, the first additional field of each transferred row could contain NULL-bytes and/or garbage characters.

As of then, the consistency check will also check whether users assigned to tasks, folders, or on header level have been deleted. If the check detects any deleted users, messages are raised and may cause the consistency check to fail due to errors. The following logic will be applied:  If a deleted user is assigned as the user responsible, processing user, or remote processing user, the consistency check fails. No task list generation is possible.  If a deleted user is assigned as an interested user, the consistency check is successful, but it shows warnings. Task list generation is possible.  If a user group consists only of deleted users and is assigned as the responsible user group or processing user group, the consistency check fails. No task list generation is possible.  If a user group consists only of deleted users and is assigned as an interested user group, the consistency check is successful, but it shows warnings. Task list generation is possible.    A consistency check for all templates will automatically be triggered when this enhancement is released, and the status will be set accordingly.  App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: In preparation for this upcoming change, you can already check your task list templates for assignments of deleted users in roles that would cause the consistency checks to fail. This way, you can prevent the consistency checks from failing after the release of this enhancement. To check for such assignments, do the following:  In your task list template, check the assignments on header level for deleted users:  Still on header level, go to Tasks.  In the corresponding user assignment columns, check for the value ***. This will show you users who have been deleted.    In the Closing Structure table of your task list template, do the same to check assignments on folder level.

"SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime";"Cloud Foundry";"Mirroring of Partitioned Flag in Cookies for Sticky Sessions";"The __VCAP_ID__ cookie now mirrors the Partitioned flag from the JSESSIONID cookie that is used to activate sticky sessions on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime. This enables you to adjust your apps to the Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) partitioning model. You may need to do this to restore the functionality of sticky sessions for embedded content on Google Chrome, which is impacted by the stricter rules for cross-platform cookies that Google recently introduced.  Action:  If your app uses sticky sessions in combination with embedded content (like iFrame or AJAX/fetch requests), requests with embedded content may break if users access the app in Google Chrome.  To restore the functionality of sticky sessions for embedded content, you can now enable the Partitioned flag for your JSESSIONID cookie and adjust your app to follow the CHIPS model, in line with the approach suggested in the SAP Note 3409306  (Permanent Solutions section).  Details:  Sticky sessions on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime are activated by using the JSESSIONID cookie. This cookie is forwarded into embedded requests as well. With the stricter cross-platform cookie rules that were introduced for Google Chrome, such cookies must now be marked as Partitioned.  SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime uses the JSESSIONID cookie to derive another cookie, __VCAP_ID__. The __VCAP_ID__ cookie is used by Gorouter to pin requests from a particular user to the same application instance.  Prior to this release, the __VCAP_ID__ cookie did not mirror the Partitioned flag from the JSESSIONID cookie. Now the Partitioned flag will be mirrored, which enables you to use sticky sessions with embedded content following the new rules for cross-platform cookies.";"Recommended";"General Availability";"Changed";"Technology";"2024-03-21";"2024-03-21";"Cloud"

All new fields will be parsed automatically and can be used for troubleshooting.  If you are using custom parsers behind an active syslog-drain, you potentially need to adjust parsing rules and regular expressions.

By turning on this option, you will see these new commercially-oriented columns added to the main table: Entitlement Source, Licensed Quantity, and Commercial Type.

"Cloud Management Tools,SAP BTP Cockpit";"ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other";"Usability Enhancements Added to SAP BTP Cockpit ""Entitlements"" Pages";"We've made several improvements to the Entitlements  Entity Assignments and Entitlements  Service Assignments in SAP BTP cockpit to enhance usability when managing service assignments in your global account.      Changed layout in Entity Assignments page: The Entity Assignments page now offers two views (tabs):      Manage Assignments: This is where global account admins can distribute the entitled service plans of their global account to subaccounts and directories. The functionality remains the same as before, except for the Configure Entitlements button that has been renamed to Edit.    View Commercial Information: This new tab allows global account admins and viewers to view the commercial source of their entitlements. This feature is not available for trial accounts.        Changed layout in Service Assignments page: The Service Overview option has been moved out of the Service dropdown menu and now has its own All Services view (tab) in the Service Assignments page. As a result, the Service Assignments page now has two views (tabs):      All Services: Provides an overview of all available service entitlements of your global account.      Assignments by Service: Allows you to choose specific services and see how their service plans are assigned to subaccounts and directories within your global account.          Improved visibility of free service plans: When configuring assignments in the Entity Assignments page, the Add Service Plans dialog box now displays the ""Always Free"" and ""Free Tier"" labels for service plans falling into these categories. This enhancement allows you to easily identify which plans are not charged for consumption.      Enhanced Service Assignments page: In the Service Assignments page, under the All Services view, we have added a new column called Assigned To. It shows you the total number of directories and subaccounts to which each service plan is assigned in your global account. You can click on the links in this column to quickly navigate to the selected service view and display more details about these assignments.      Access to service-related links: Documentation links, support info links, and SAP Discovery Center links, have been added when available. These links can be accessed in the Add Service Plans dialog box in the Entity Assignments page and in the main table of both Entitlements pages by clicking on the new    (Service Details) icon for any service listed under the Service Technical Name column.      Improved search functionality: In both Entitlements pages, the Search field has been relocated to the top of the page. You can now search for more than one term. Also, when you start typing, you get a list of suggestions. This change makes it more convenient for you to quickly search for specific entitlements or services.      New Plan Display Name column: We've added a new Plan Display Name column to both Entitlements pages. By default, this column is hidden, but you can choose to display it if needed.

To ensure consistency between the Istio trace settings, the Telemetry module's trace feature, and OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions, we have improved the service.name value, which is attached to every span emitted by the Istio proxy. To determine the service name, the Istio module now follows the same conventions as the Telemetry module. First, it tries to leverage the kubernetes.io/name label. If not available, it checks for the app label. If neither label is present, it falls back to using the Deployment's name. Additionally, the namespace suffix is not attached anymore to the service name, which aligns with the conventions of OpenTelemetry.  We have also changed the Istio tracer from the deprecated OpenCensus tracer to OpenTelemetry. This update has resulted in an improvement to the Istio span name, which is now prefixed with the operation name. For example, a name like example.com is changed to ingress example.com.

Some highlights include:  Stories improvements:   As a story designer using the optimized story experience, you now have the option to define which of the following filter types you would like to pass through an internal (page or story) hyperlink: story, page, local, or linked analysis filters.  For bar/column charts and horizontal waterfall charts created in the optimized design experience, you can now choose to show a variance as a waterfall chart.  In the optimized experience, you can now configure the variable settings to preserve the current variable selections (current behavior) when a story is opened or to use the server-defined default values.  For tables in the optimized story experience, you can now sort on version dimension members.  In the optimized story experience, you can now add geo map filters as dynamic text.  Exporting a Story to PowerPoint is now supported in optimized view mode. In addition, as a story developer in story experience, you can use the Export to PowerPoint technical object with script APIs to customize the export experience.  When using the Export dialog to export an optimized story as a PDF, you can now have the export process run in the background by setting the option Enable Export in the Background. However, the option will be disabled for classic stories that have enabled Optimized View Mode.  As a story designer in optimized story experience, you can now customize the view time toolbar for phone and tablet, in addition to desktop. Related interactive tutorial is available: Interactive Tutorial: Customizing View Time Toolbar in Optimized Story Experience.  As a story designer in optimized story experience, you can add geo map filters as a dynamic text.  Exporting Story to PowerPoint is now supported in optimized view mode. In addition, as a story developer in optimized story experience, you can use the Export to PowerPoint technical object with script APIs to customize the export experience.  Custom widgets can now be bookmarked in optimized story experience. As a custom widget developer, you can enable bookmark support for your custom widget in its JSON file.  As a story developer in optimized story experience, you can use a Text Pool technical object with related APIs to translate the texts in the scripts.  As a story developer in optimized story experience, you can use setSelectedMembersWithUnbooked and getActiveSelectedMembersWithUnbooked APIs to set and get selected members on the input control, including unbooked ones.  The Lite Viewer is now available for SAP Analytics Cloud users. This feature is an extension of the Optimized (Unified) Experience that loads the lightest version of the application. To view a story using the Light Viewer:  The story must be part of Optimized (Unified) Experience.  The story should be limited to only core Business Intelligence (BI) functionality- it should exclude Planning and Advanced BI including Scripting, CSS, and so on.  The story must be opened via a URL in Embed mode; it cannot be opened in the View or Present modes.  When a story does not meet these requirements, you will be automatically re-directed to the full Optimized (Unified) Experience view. This Lite Viewer initial release includes upgrades for geographical visualizations to ArcGIS 4.X to benefit from:  Improved rendering performance: map graphics are now rendered using WebGL resulting in a more rapid display of both small and large datasets, including smooth transitions when the map is zoomed or panned.  Improved datapoint interaction: when hovering over datapoints, they are now highlighted to improve interaction. Also, overlapping datapoints are now detected to provide a quicker understanding of the data context.    You can now use the fluid data entry mode in tables built on SAP BPC live data models.  In stories, you can now add data point comments to tables when dimension properties are used in table axes or filters. Similarly, you can also add comments in comment widgets when dimension properties are used in comment widget filters.  In a table of a story built on a new model type (but without an account dimension), you can now add data point comments when Measure Values (the default cross calculation) or restricted cross calculations are in the table axes or filters. Note that: Previously, you can add data point comments when a restricted cross calculation is used in the filter, but the specific filters on dimensions used to define this cross calculation will not be included in the context for comments. Now, they will be included in the context. Comments are not supported for calculated cross calculations or aggregations. Comments sourced from restricted cross calculations will also be shown in the comment widget when the same context applies.    Planning mprovements:   You can now manually migrate a copy of an existing allocation process or step to a data action with the Migrate to Data Action button in the legacy allocations app. The existing allocation process or step won't be affected. You can also migrate an existing allocation step (as part of a data action) created by referencing a legacy allocation step to one that supports detailed configuration in the data action designer.  Note that creating an allocation process or step using the legacy allocations app, as well as an allocation step (as part of a data action) that references a legacy allocation step, is no longer supported. We recommend using the allocation step in data actions to configure your allocation.  The data action designer now allows you to switch between displaying the ID or description of dimension members from the Display section of the toolbar, to help identify the correct members.  In advanced formulas, with the new configuration function of CONFIG.READ_CALCULATED_MEMBER_VALUES, calculated members, which include non-leaf members, account members with formulas, and calculated measures, can now be defined in and read by RESULTLOOKUP and LINK functions. This configuration function is only supported on SAP Analytics Cloud tenants based on SAP HANA Cloud platform. For details, see CONFIG.READ_CALCULATED_MEMBER_VALUES at About Script Formulas and Calculations in Advanced Formulas for Planning.  In advanced formulas, you can now define a virtual variable member for the version dimension in VARIABLEMEMBER.  In the predictive step of multi actions, you can now use Train Only and Apply Only actions to retrain and apply the predictive model separately. These two new actions come especially handy in what-if simulations, where you can apply the predictive model to different versions with distinct future values for the influencers and produce forecasts, without having to retrain the predictive model multiple times.      Calendar improvements:   As owner of SAP Analytics Cloud calendar events or as assignee of a calendar process, you can now enable the access to your calendar events from external applications. A calendar API allows you to interact with the events in the SAP Analytics Cloud calendar. For details, see Access Calendar Events Using the Calendar API.  As the creator of calendar processes or manual calendar tasks, you can now enable all involved parties to view the events in Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams. For details, see Integrate Your Calendar Events in Microsoft Tools.    Modeling improvements:   The modeler has been extensively redesigned to align with the changes made to models in SAP Analytics Cloud. Models are now more flexible, and you can select how you’d like to build your model. When creating a new model in the Modeler, the application lets you decide whether you want to focus on the data first approach followed by building your model structure, or build your model structure first followed by adding your data. At the heart of this redesign is the new model type, whose capabilities have been extended to offer more flexibility to your modeling workflows. While you can still create classic account models and datasets, we encourage you to try out the new model type to benefit from the latest functionalities available. For more information, check out Get Started with Flexible Modeling, or this blog.   The Data Export API has been extended and now support Public Dimensions. This compliments the Data Import Service API – Master Data Public Dimension, recently released in QRC Q3 2023.  Three new formulas are now available: YearToDate (YTD), QuarterToDate (QTD) and MonthToDate (MTD). These formulas will help modeler and planners perform running totals across time granularities for a given year, quarter, or month.  The Calculations workspace in the modeler now offers an Object Dependency Graph, which provides a graphical representation of object relationships.  The Detail() formula is now deprecated. We strongly recommend replacing this formula in your models with an Exception Aggregation using type SUM and Exception Aggregation Dimension using All Members to see the achieve results. For more information, see: KBA 3235670 - Details () Formula in SAP Analytics Cloud Modeler is Deprecated. For more details on the Data Export API improvements, new formulas and the new dependency graph, check out this blog.     Augmented Analytics improvements:   Just Ask, powered by artificial intelligence, is a natural language query interface used to query data.  Acquired data model support: Classic account and new models.  Initial support of live SAP Datasphere.  Supports queries in English.  Supports copying results to a story and opening data analyzer.    Enhanced accuracy:  Just Ask supports LLM learning enhanced learning with each release.  Automatically infers similar words based on meaning.  Supports customizing synonyms for both metadata and master data.    Enhanced relevancy of query results:   Centrally set searchable models.   Reduces ambiguity when different models include the same names.  Captures user intent through preset rules.      Commenting and Scheduling improvements:   Data point commenting is now supported in models that have role-based data security applied via model privacy. You can comment on data points if you have role-based permissions for multiple read and write permissions on more than one dimension.  You can now use the Include Formatting option while scheduling a publication with the CSV file type and keep the numerical formatting precisely as it appears in the table or chart.  The No End Date option is no longer available. We recommend not creating recurrent schedules with this option. For all existing recurring scheduled publications that are created with the No End Date option, it is recommended to update the series with a definite number of recurrences or an end date to continue uninterrupted scheduled publication under the End Recurrence By option. Schedules with No End Date recurrences will start having their occurrences canceled after a year.  As a Schedule Owner, you now get notified via email whenever the status of your scheduled publication changes from open to partially successful, failed, or canceled. You can view details of the status by clicking the Open Task button on the notification email.

Authentication was no longer working after changing LDAP settings, because the configuration was modified wrongly when persisting the LDAP changes.  The list of trusted certificates could not be adjusted anymore after activating certificate-based authentication.    Compatibility mode in bgRFC for sending units to old SAP NetWeaver 7.01 systems contains dummy RFC_PING invocations to reflect some constraints in such a scenario. The Cloud Connector, however, required RFC_PING to be part of the access control list and hence did not automatically allow it, like it should be for such infrastructure-related, remote-enabled functions. This issue could occur in IBP integration scenarios.  The proxy check could wrongly indicate that the HTTPS proxy is not reachable.  A vulnerability could occur in the Cloud Connector due to improper checking of certificates.For more information, see SAP security note 3424610 .

We are doing so by raising the OpenSSL security level to 2. This will result in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR  While the change has already been rolled out on the regions br10 and eu20 in November 2023, the remaining regions are scheduled to follow on February 22, 2024.  Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates/mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.  Action:  If you are using client certificates/mTLS, you can check your certificate chain using the following command: openssl verify -auth_level=2 -CAfile ./ca.pem -untrusted ./intermediate.pem ./cert.pem  For more details on the command, see 3333978 .

"Connectivity";"Cloud Foundry,Kyma";"Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes - New Features";"A new version of the Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes (1.4.0) has been released.Transparent Proxy version 1.4.0 provides the following new features:  Multitenancy support for seamless consumption of target systems defined as TCP destinations in the different tenants and exposed locally on the level of TCP protocol. The actual communication protocol may be any TCP-based protocol, for example, ODBC/JDBC, SMTP, etc. For more information, see Multitenancy.  Simple arbitrary access to destinations. Dynamically access the target systems via a single destination custom resource, instead of creating such for every locally exposed destination.For more information, see Dynamic Lookup of Destinations.  Native integration with Istio. Easily, via single configuration, add the target systems or service endpoints exposed via Transparent Proxy to the Istio service mesh.For more information, see Configuration Guide.   Native integration with the Connectivity Proxy in multi-tenant trusted mode. You can now easily consume target systems without sending identity tokens to the Connectivity Proxy.  Automated update of service keys, in use by Transparent Proxy, upon Kubernetes secrets change.   The Transparent Proxy module in Kyma now auto-detects and loads all Destination service instance bindings within its namespace, reducing the need for manual configuration. For more information, see Transparent Proxy in the Kyma Environment.  The Transparent Proxy module in Kyma now, by default, creates a Destination service instance and binding upon enabling the module, significantly simplifying the initial setup.For more information, see Transparent Proxy in the Kyma Environment.

"Connectivity";"Cloud Foundry,Neo";"Cloud Connector 2.16.1 - Bug Fixes";"Release of Cloud Connector version 2.16.1 provides the following bug fixes:    LDAP role names were wrongly displayed in the administration UI. Actually, the position was shifted by one. Note  The runtime was not affected.This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  Passwords with leading or trailing spaces did not work neither in the logon screen nor in the LDAP test UI. When creating a backup in the administration UI with a password containing special characters, it could not be restored. This was a regression introduced with version 2.15.1.The issue has been fixed.Note  Creating backups with the REST API was not affected.    Selecting a subaccount in the administration UI might have failed. This happened if there are more than 100 subaccounts hosted on the Cloud Connector instance and when filtering the subaccount list. In this case, a completely different one was selected when choosing the subaccount. This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  During an upgrade via RPM it could happen that the UI after the initial login screen was not loading. In the traces of the Cloud Connector, you could see many messages telling that a JAR file could not be found that was existing only before the upgrade. This could be resolved by a restart of the daemon only. The issue was caused by another issue in upgrade processing, which has been improved to avoid the erroneous situation.  Avoid a NullPointerException when receiving a close request in RFC protocol processing. This could lead to wrong values for the connection monitor for RFC connections. The call stack of the exception started with java.lang.NullPointerException: while trying to invoke the method com.sap.core.connectivity.spi.processing.TargetHost.connectionProtocol() of a null object loaded from local variable 'target' at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.updateNonRequestBased(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:109) at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.reportCloseConnection(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:96)  Corrupted subaccounts could not be loaded properly. As a consequence, it was impossible to delete them from the administration UI. In some cases, they even did not appear in the list of subaccounts, but were existing, so trying to add such a subaccount would fail.This issue has been fixed.      Self-signed system certificates containing SANs need to have all CA attributes, which is not desired for the system certificate, and hence it does not have them. As a consequence, such a certificate cannot be added to the trust store of a server, which is needed to establish trust. By not allowing to add SAN elements to self-signed system certificates, this problem can no longer occur.      A denial of service vulnerability in the Cloud Connector was fixed.For more information, see security note https://me.sap.com/notes/3362463.

"SAP Analytics Cloud";"Other";"Features for 2023 QRC 4 (version 2023.24)";"We are happy to inform you that with the release of SAP Analytics Cloud Q4 2023, all the supporting documentation is available on SAP Help Portal.     On the SAP Analytics Cloud product page, you’ll find a complete set of SAP Analytics Cloud guides and resources.  Some highlights include:  General imrpovements:  SAP Analytics Cloud now has a new embedded help experience with SAP Companion. Explore the UI with summary help popovers to get more context and learn about different features. Watch embedded video tutorials to become familiar with common tasks and access a curated list of interactive, self-directed learning tutorials that are relevant to the screen you're on. With the enhanced help, streamline the process it takes for you to find additional guidance and learning content so you can get the right information when you need it the most!Check out our community blog for more details as well as our new video on how to find help for SAP Analytics Cloud.    Stories improvements:  In table forecast layouts, you can now set Week as the granularity for Range (a new option used for setting the timeframe covered in a forecast layout), Look back additional, and Look ahead additional. In rolling forecast layouts, the Week granularity is now available for Look back and Look ahead.  When creating stacked bar/column charts or stacked area charts in the optimized design experience, you can now add both the version (or category) dimension and other dimensions to the color feed.  When adding the Version (or Category) dimension to the Color section for your chart, you can now choose to use the measures/accounts to set the color and patterns. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.  When creating story calculations based on data from the new model (with an account dimension), you can now use MEMBERLOOKUP and ACCOUNTLOOKUP functions in the calculations. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.  When using a restricted measure calculation that includes a Version dimension, you can now remove the version dimension from the chart axis. This feature is only available in the optimized story experience.    Planning improvements:  When you use the Add Member functionality, inner dimension members relative to the member where you trigger this functionality are now automatically replicated and filled into the new line. This enhancement is also available to tables built on SAP BPC live data models.  When configuring a version management step in multi actions, you now have the option to decide how you want your data to publish. You can choose to automatically publish your changes and have the publish fail if there are any restrictions, or you can choose to automatically publish your changes and discard any data that is affected by restrictions.  When configuring the API step of multi actions, you can now select the Require CSRF Token checkbox and enter a CSRF token URL if a CSRF token is required by the external application you want to use.  You can now benefit from the features of Multi Actions Service API on the SAP Business Accelerator Hub.  In data actions, you can now select the checkbox Allow ""All Members"" as a parameter property. Parameters with this property enabled can be used in the source context of different types of data action steps. In data action triggers, you can now choose Member Selection, Input Control, or Story Filter to set values for such parameters using the All Members selection.  In validation rules created by combining dimension members, you can now copy dimension member combinations from other applications like Microsoft Excel or from existing member combinations, and paste them into the validation rule grid, either by using dedicated buttons or via keyboard shortcuts. This helps you quicky add many member combinations into your rule.  In IF statements of advanced formulas, you can now use ""=="" or ""!=="" to define a dimension combination filter that produces a scope of dimension member combinations based on whether or not dimension properties match.  When editing a public version with the recommended planning area defined in the model settings, you can now first select the checkbox Auto-generate based on the table context in the Builder panel of the table you're working on before putting the public version into Edit Mode. The recommended planning area that's applied also takes into account the table context that covers story, page, and table filters. This helps you further restrict the size of the recommended planning area to improve performance, especially for large public versions.  The following Story APIs can now be used to customize the planning area:  As an application designer or story developer in optimized story experience, you can use getPlanningAreaInfo with filter related APIs to define customized planning area. You can further use startEditMode and copy API to edit or copy the customized planning area.  As an application designer or story developer in optimized story experience, you can use startEditMode API to start edit mode on specific planning areas in public versions.  In both analytics designer and optimized story experience, the copy API to now supports the options to create a planning version from visible data and customized planning area.      Calendar improvements:  Next to the planned start and end dates of calendar events, you can now see the actual dates of the events in the List workspace and in the Details panel of an event. Both planned and actual dates are visualized in the Gantt chart. Administrators can turn off the display of the actual dates under System > Administration. For details, see Work in the List Workspace.  To better identify overdue and delayed events, you can now filter your calendar List workspace according to their time-related status (On Track, Delayed, or Overdue). For details, see Filter Calendar Events.  You can now view the time zone in which a calendar task series was created by selecting the globe icon in the Time section of a series or single occurrence. If a series takes place during a daylight-saving time change, it is adjusted accordingly and takes place one hour earlier or later. Note that you need to update existing series to make use of this feature.  Until now, you could add parent processes to events. Now you can also add or remove direct child events in the Details panel of a process. For more information, see Work with Processes.  You can now reset the setting changes of decoupled occurrences so they match the series settings again. You can do this either from the Details panel of the decoupled occurrences, from the Details panel of the series, or when you update the series. For more information, see Working With Series in Work with Calendar Events You Created.    Modeling improvements:  A new ToPeriod formula now allows you to aggregate a running total across flexible time granularities for a given period. This dynamic formula will help modelers create calculated measures using Year-to-Date, Quarter-to-Date and Month-to-Date running totals at a model level, and reuse them in stories. ToPeriod can also be used in combination with LOOKUP or RESTRICT.  You can now combine formulas with other formulas in calculated measures. This improvement will save you time, as you’ll no longer have to create multiple calculated measure to combine LOOKUP, RESTRICT, YOY, SMA & CAGR with other formulas.  Performance improvements are possible for currency rates tables containing large volumes of data. This follows the introduction of the Data Import API for currency data in QRC3. These include improved loading times, saving times, and improved filtering handling for large currency rates tables.  As a preview for what’s coming next in the Modeling and upcoming enhancements, check out this blog.    Data Analyzer improvements:  You can now find the following improvements for the chart usage in data analyzer:  You can now also use the Stacked Column and the Stacked Bar charts for the visualization of your data.  You can now use the chart visualization with all model types except the classic account model.  There are user experience improvements in the builder panel for charts.    In the table visualization in data analyzer you can now scroll horizontally if the table has a large number of columns. If there are more than 100 columns a warning message is displayed to use the filter function and restrict the number of columns.  In data analyzer you can now drag objects from the builder panel on the table. The following object types are supported:  Dimensions  Display attributes (connected with the associated dimension)  Measure/Account structures      For a complete list of the new features brought to SAP Analytics Cloud as part of the Q4 2023 launch, check out the brand new What’s New Viewer.

"Identity Provisioning";"Neo";"Changing users and groups update mechanism";"As of October 25, 2023, Identity Provisioning is changing the way users and groups are updated in the target systems.

Currently, Identity Provisioning resolves the entity prior to applying the mapping of its unique attribute.  When the new mechanism is introduced, if the given mapping contains a function (for example, for removing a substring or concatenating a prefix), the service will handle it correctly. The entity won’t be skipped and will be properly updated.  Be aware that this change will affect you if you have the following three configurations in place:      The unique attribute is missing in the target transformation. Even if you've defined it as a property in <system_prefix>.user.unique.attribute or <system_prefix>.group.unique.attribute, it is still missing in the target transformation.      The skipOperation create is defined under the user or group resource in the target transformation.      The support for patch operations is enabled in the target system.      If you experience any issues when this change is introduced, make sure the unique attribute mapping is not missing in your target transformation.

"Kyma Runtime";"Kyma";"Release of the NATS module";"We are happy to announce NATS as a new module for the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime. This module ships the NATS Manager, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a NATS JetStream deployment. It observes the state of the NATS cluster and reconciles its state according to the desired state.  NATS is an infrastructure that enables the exchange of data in the form of messages. JetStream is a distributed persistence system providing more functionalities and higher qualities of service on top of ‘Core NATS’. For further information about NATS and NATS JetStream, consult the Official NATS Documentation.  Kyma Eventing can use NATS as backend to process events and send them to subscribers.  NATS is an optional module, which you can activate as required. By default, it will be inactive when you create a new Kyma cluster. For details, see Enable and Disable a Kyma Module.  We invite you to learn more about NATS in Kyma and appreciate your feedback or contribution to our GitHub project.

Action:  Older clients might be affected by this change. To maintain connectivity, please check and ensure that your clients are supporting one of the following TLS 1.2 ciphers that are still supported:     TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      After the deletion of the deprecated ciphers, requests from older HTTP client libraries that do not include any of the supported ciphers will fail during the TLS handshake. To verify that your client can connect without CBC ciphers, you can connect it to the following test application. If the client can establish a connection to the endpoint, the server returns the message ok along with a status code 200.

To do that, check the Enable and Disable a Kyma Module tutorial.  The Serverless module features a new API - Serverless custom resource - which you can use to configure Serverless. For more details, see the Serverless configuration guides.  New versions of the Serverless module, with new features, bug fixes, or security patches, will be distributed to your Kyma runtimes using the release channels.

"SAP Java Buildpack";"Cloud Foundry";"Interface com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo has been deprecated";"With SAP Java Buildpack 1.77.0, component xs-user-holder is changed due to deprecated code in SAP BTP Security Services Integration Libraries, on which it relies.  Interface com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo was deprecated and later removed with version 3.0.0 of cloud-security-services-integration-library. For more information, see: SAP BTP Security Services Integration Libraries: v 3.0.0  This interface is replaced by a new one – com.sap.xs.security.UserData. It's introduced with version 1.47.0 of xs-user-holder.   If your pom.xml file contains the following <dependency>, that means your project uses xs-user-holder and needs to be adapted:   <dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sjb</groupId>
    <artifactId>xs-user-holder</artifactId>
</dependency>
  The xs-user-holder component currently provides getter and setter methods for working with the deprecated com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo.   Action: If your code uses these methods, make the following modifications:      Replace UserInfoHolder.getUserInfo() with UserInfoHolder.getUserData()      Replace UserInfoHolder.setUserInfo(XSUserInfo userInfo) with UserInfoHolder.setUserData(UserData userData)      Note      The same token information that XSUserInfo provides can be obtained with the new UserData interface.      Getter and setter methods for the deprecated com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo will remain available in the xs-user-holder component, and will coexist with the methods from com.sap.xs.security.UserData till December 31, 2023.      When this period is over, everything based on the deprecated code from package com.sap.xsa.security.container will be removed, and only the new UserData interface will be supported in the xs-user-holder component.

Previously, enabling the entitlement and user management features for a directory was only possible after the directory was created, from the directory's Users and Entitlements pages.   Now, we've made it easier for you to enable these features right from the start when you create a directory, or when editing a directory from the Account Explorer page.  Furthermore, we've added the ability to enable the entitlement management feature for any directory directly on the global account's Entitlements  Entity Entitlements page. Until now, this page did not allow you to select directories that weren't enabled to manage entitlements. Now, these directories can be selected.
