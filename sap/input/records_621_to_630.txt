Title: Consistency Check Adjustment
Description: As of now, the consistency check confirms whether a user group assigned in the task list template contains any users. If a user group is empty, the consistency check issues a warning message for now, allowing you to continue with task list generations.

This error will then prevent you from generating task lists.  More information:  How to Perform Checks on Templates  App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: Ensure that you don't have empty user groups. Pay special attention to the warning messages raised for empty user groups and address the changes required.
