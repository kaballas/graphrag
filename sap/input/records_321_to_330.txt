Title: Istio module: Update to version 1.20.2
Description: Version 1.20.2 introduces the following improvements:      The Istio module now supports the use of Istio sidecars as Kubernetes init containers. In addition to the default Istio containers, the module also restarts native sidecar init containers. However, configuring native sidecars directly from the Istio Custom Resource (CR) is not supported. For more information, see issue #1426.Caution  If your cluster's Istio service mesh includes workloads with initContainer sidecars, the Istio module will restart these workloads for the first time. See Restart of Workloads with Enabled Istio Sidecar Injection, Istio sidecar documentation, and Kubernetes Native Sidecars in Istio.    We've updated the Istio version to 1.26.2. For more information, read the Istio 1.26.2 release announcement and Istio 1.26.0 release announcement.  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.  We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled.  We've fixed a bug where the app.kubernetes.io/version label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources.
