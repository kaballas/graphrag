Title: API Gateway module: Update to version 3.1.1
Description: Release 3.1.0 of the API Gateway module changes the stored version of APIRule to v2alpha1. This change is part of the migration process towards the v2 version, which will eventually result in removing the v1beta1 version.   This releases also contains the following improvements:    We've fixed behavior of in-cluster connectivity when using JWT handler in APIRule. Now, in-cluster connectivity is blocked.   We've fixed the extAuth handler not being scoped to a particular host.  We've fixed reconciliation of convertible APIRules.  When converting APIRule to version v2, the original-version annotation is not set if it's already present in the APIRule.  The order of rules in the APIRule Custom Resource is important. Rules defined earlier in the list have a higher priority than those defined later. For more information, see Significance of Rule Path Order.

Component: SAP Dynamic Forms
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Release 2505
Description:     SAP Dynamic Forms setup on Preview environment: If you want to try out upcoming changes to the application before they go live in the standard environment, we have added SAP Dynamic Forms, Preview to the SAP Business Technology Platform Service Marketplace as an additional option. For more information on how to set up a subscription to this new service, see OPTIONAL: Set up SAP Dynamic Forms, Preview on SAP Business Technology Platform.    Note  SAP suggests that customers use Preview for their development and QA landscapes in order to validate each SAP Dynamic Forms release prior to the production roll-out.        Separation of Form Builder, Form Runner, and Form Administrator Roles: Previously, you could only set up Roles and Role Collections by granting users access to the Form Builder, Form Administrator, and Form Runner features simultaneously. Going forward, by creating separate Roles, you can assign access to Form Builder, Form Runner, and Form Administrator individually. For more information, see:    Setting Up Roles and Role Collections for SAP Dynamic Forms Users      End-User Roles and Role Collections          Sending Emails with SAP Dynamic Forms Information: You can send emails to individuals and general inboxes to alert your employees about Dynamic Forms. This is an event that is part of the SAP Dynamic Forms event processing. You can include data from SAP Dynamic Forms (Forms, Business Objects, etc) in the email message. For more information, see Sending Emails with Dynamic Form Information.      Form Builder list view improvements: Similar to Form Runner, now you can also see the following information about Form Instances, on the Form Builder list page:    Created By      Last Changed By      Latest Published Version      Last Published date          Bulk delete of Form Instances: On the Forms Admin page, you can now delete all Form Instances for an Application, Form, or Version. The deletion action is no longer limited to the list of selected Form Instances displayed on a single page.      Support Form Definition permissions: In Form Builder you can now set up permissions for Form Definitions as well:    Read: Required for users to view a Form Definition.      Update: Required for users to update and save a Form Definition.      Publishing Form Definitions requires Admin role.          Bug fixes:    Measurement Point Custom Control upper and lower limits do not account for European numerical syntax.      Creating a Form Template with duplicate name incorrectly returns 500 error.      Form Instances created in SAP Service and Asset Manager must run the initial value formulas.      Support email address lengths longer than 50 characters.      SAP Service and Asset Manager client is not prompted to save changes if the cursor focus remains on the only changed control.      Remove Clear button from the Form Runner and the mobile form engine.      Limit log message length.      PDF generation on device may fail for some Forms with the Measurement Point Custom Control feature.
