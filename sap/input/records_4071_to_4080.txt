Component: Application Autoscaler
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Increase of Maximum cpu Threshold
Description: In the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment, applications get a guaranteed CPU share of ¼ core per GB instance memory. As the maximum instance memory per application is 8 GBm this allows for vertical scaling up to 2 CPUs. See SAP BTP-Specific Configurations.  To support this, the maximum value that can be set for the threshold parameter when writing a dynamic scaling rule with the metric type cpu is now 200.
