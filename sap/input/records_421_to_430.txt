Component: Pricing Service
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Pre-Production - Document Pricing – Do Not Lose Condition Values During Repricing
Description: If a price recalculation with type C (Carries out a new pricing, manually entered conditions are retained) was triggered, an automatically determined condition value used to get lost in the following case: The condition appeared twice in the results, one value with control flag A (Adjust for quantity variance) and origin flag A (Automatic pricing) and another value with control flag C (Changed manually) and origin flag C (Manually entered/changed). This issue has been corrected, which can lead to unexpected pricing results if the issue was unnoticed before.

Description: Pricing service will stop writing pricing determination traces when an estimated memory size of about 5MB is reached. That should be sufficient for most cases.
