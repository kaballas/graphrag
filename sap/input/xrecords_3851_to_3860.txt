Component: Kyma Runtime
Environment: Kyma
Title: Release of the Eventing module
Description: We are proud to announce the release of the Eventing module, which replaces Kyma's classic Eventing component.  It is enabled by default in all the existing clusters with the NATS module added or with the Eventing component configured to use SAP Event Mesh. In clusters without such prior configuration and in new ones, you must enable the Eventing module manually. For details, see Enable and Disable a Kyma Module.  Kyma's Eventing module manages the lifecycle of Eventing resources - it observes the state of Eventing resources and reconciles them according to the desired state.  If you want to use NATS as eventing backend, enable our NATS module as well.  We invite you to learn more about Eventing in Kyma and appreciate your feedback or contribution in our GitHub project.
