Title: New Parameters for Subaccount Creation in btp CLI and SAP Cloud Management Service API
Description: We've introduced two new parameters in the btp create accounts/subaccount command of the btp CLI and in the POST /accounts/v1/subaccounts API of the SAP Cloud Management service for SAP BTP, respectively:      disable-wait-for-auto-assign-plans (btp CLI) / DisableWaitForAutoAssignPlans (API): Allows administrators to specify if the subaccount creation should proceed without waiting for the auto-assignment of base entitlements to complete, which is useful for speeding up the subaccount creation process, particularly in scenarios where quick setup is prioritized over consistency. The default value is false, which is recommended for consistency and reliability, especially when using the command or API to run automated scripts and integrations.      skip-auto-assign-plans (btp CLI) / skipAutoAssignPlans (API): This parameter allows administrators to specify if the subaccount creation should exclude the auto-assignment of base entitlements. If you know in advance that you do not need the base auto-assignments, this offers a quicker subaccount setup and potentially less resource consumption. The default value is false, which includes the base auto-assigned plans.      See btp-create-accounts-subaccount (btp CLI) and POST /accounts/v1/subaccounts (API).
