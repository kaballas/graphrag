Component: SAP BTP Administrator's Guide
Environment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other
Title: Introducing the SAP BTP Administrator's Guide
Description: We’ve improved the documentation structure to more effectively meet the needs of our users:   What was formerly known as “Best Practices for SAP BTP” is now targeted towards administrative tasks and best practices, providing a more streamlined resource for administrators. It has therefore been renamed to SAP BTP Administrator's Guide.  All our recommendations about developing applications, some of which used to be part of the Best Practices as well, have been consolidated in the SAP BTP Developer’s Guide.   This restructuring aims to ensure that both developers and administrators can easily find relevant and specialized guidance.

When using the Template feature, you can now edit and confirm extraction results for the associated document by choosing it on the details page for the template you've created.      Also on the Template details page, you can now set an extraction method for individual fields or for all fields your template. The available methods are Template and AI.      See View and Edit Extraction Results, Add Documents and Activate/Deactivate Template, and Add Template.
