Title: Deprecation of the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition Administrator Role Collection
Description: The SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition Administrator role collection has been deprecated. You can still assign and keep it assigned to your users, but it's no longer managed by SAP. This means that, to this deprecated role collection, SAP won't include new roles that might be necessary for the use of features released as of March 2024.  For having the role collection maintained by SAP with up-to-date authorizations, assign the new SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition - Administrator role collection to your user.
