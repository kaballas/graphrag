Title: Issue with SOX Compliance Check Fixed
Description: An issue with the check for SOX compliance has been fixed. Previously, the check upon approval compared the user stored in the Last Changed By field against the approving user. However, if a technical user was used for a successful job, this check would always be passed successfully. Now the check for SOX compliance compares the following information:  If the task status was changed manually, the approving user is compared against the user stored in the Last Changed By field.  If the task status was not changed manually, the approving user is compared against the user stored in the Triggered By field.    App affected:  Approve Closing Tasks
