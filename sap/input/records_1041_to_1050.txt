Title: Security Hardening for Redirect URIs
Description: The target audience for the change are developers.  We're going to make the following change for security reasons. Redirect URIs without wildcards only match the exact entry.  If you've deployed custom web applications and defined OAuth redirect URIs without wildcards (*), the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service accepts arbitrary subdomains and paths.    Example  The allowed URI https://myhost.com matches also the following specific values:      https://myhost.com/somepath      https://somesubdomain.myhost.com      This isn't allowed anymore. Only https://myhost.com is accepted after the change.    Action  For affected applications, update the redirect URIs in the application security descriptor with the specific URI and/or wildcards. This ensures that they match the specific URIs during user logon after the stricter rules are in effect.  For more information, see Application Security Descriptor Configuration Syntax.

Component: Cloud Logging

Title: Update to: Improvement of the overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters by proper index sizing.
Description: Rollout of Index sizing - Improvement of the overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters by proper index sizing.  The overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters will be improved by proper index sizing, especially in high-ingest and huge storage volume scenarios. To achieve this, we will switch from daily indexes to the index rollover approach targeting the updated release date - 17. April 2025.  With this change, the index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., logs-json-2024.11.19), but a six-digit number (e.g., logs-json-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  You are affected only if you run queries against the old index suffix. In such cases you need to adapt:      Change queries to make them independent of the old index date-suffix.          If you want to query data from certain days, you can and should do that via a range query against the index pattern instead of targeting individual indexes.          Information about which indexes are mapped to a certain day, or which days are mapped to a certain index can still be obtained from the index creation date / timestamps of contained documents.      This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.

Component: SAP BTP Cockpit
Environment: Cloud Foundry,Neo
Title: Opt-In Control for Force Deletion of Subaccounts in SAP BTP
Description: To prevent accidental force deletion of subaccounts containing content, SAP BTP introduces new safeguards:    Global account administrators must now opt in to allow force deletion of subaccounts via a dedicated global account setting. This setting is located under the Subaccounts section in the global account settings and is labeled Enable Subaccounts Force Deletion. For more details on how to access and manage global account settings, see  Managing Global Accounts Using the Cockpit (Cloud Foundry) and  Managing Global Accounts Using the Cockpit (Neo environment).       Force deletion is only allowed for subaccounts not marked as Used for production. If a subaccount is marked as Used for production force deletion is always prohibited, regardless of the global setting. To modify the Used for production status of a subaccount, use the Edit Subaccount action in the Account Explorer See:     Change Subaccount Details for Cloud Foundry      Change Subaccount Details for the Neo environment          These changes apply across the SAP BTP cockpit, btp CLI, and API operations    Note  Any automation or manual operation relying on force deletion will be blocked unless:    The global setting Enable Subaccounts Force Deletion is explicitly enabled by the global account admin      The subaccount is not marked as Used for production.
