Title: Production - Pricing service – Fix for variant condition field with access type A
Description: When the multivalued attribute KOMP-VARCOND field in an access is marked as hierarchical, the access field (access type = A) and the condition record with an empty variant condition key is maintained. When variant condition keys without maintained condition records were passed as input, the Pricing service used to return different results compared to the back-end pricing. This issue has been corrected.

Title: Production – Currency Conversion – Convert a Currency
Description: There is a new endpoint called POST /currencyConversion/currencies/{fromCurrencyUnit}/convert/{toCurrencyUnit} to receive the exchange rate that is needed to convert a source currency to a target currency. With that, the calling application can convert currencies analogously to how the Pricing service does it during price calculation. The new endpoint also returns an output value converted into the target currency if an input value was given.
