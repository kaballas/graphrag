Title: App deployment option (import/export)
Description: (Version 2310) SAP Mobile Services is now integrated with the SAP Content Agent service, which introduces a new option for exporting and importing application configurations from one environment to another (such as exporting from the testing environment and importing to the production environment).  This option enables you to export all or parts of the mobile app configuration, create the mobile app configuration on the target environment, create missing features, and merge the exported configuration. SAP Content Agent service is also integrated with the SAP Cloud Transport Management service, which provides the underlying transport service. The SAP Mobile Services export/import feature remains as an alternative option for copying the entire mobile app configuration from one environment with limitations.  See:     Exporting and Importing Application Configurations      SAP Content Agent Service Integration

Component: Application Autoscaler
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Increase of Maximum cpu Threshold
Description: In the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment, applications get a guaranteed CPU share of Â¼ core per GB instance memory. As the maximum instance memory per application is 8 GBm this allows for vertical scaling up to 2 CPUs. See SAP BTP-Specific Configurations.  To support this, the maximum value that can be set for the threshold parameter when writing a dynamic scaling rule with the metric type cpu is now 200.
