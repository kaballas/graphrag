Title: Enhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors
Description: We’ve made the following enhancements:  When you view someone's information, if there's only one match for the name, their information is now displayed directly without the need for confirmation. Previously, your confirmation was required before viewing their information.    In the use cases "View peers", "View direct reports", and "View manager", inactive users are now removed from the search result. Previously, they were displayed.      In the "Create spot award" use case, if users upload an oversized image for the spot award program, as a workaround, it is automatically replaced by a default image without affecting the award creation. Previously, awards with oversized images couldn’t be successfully created.
