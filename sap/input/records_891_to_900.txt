Title: Removal of SAP Java Buildpack 1
Description: SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and will be removed from SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment on June 30, 2025. As a consequence, deployments of MTAs containing modules of type java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee might start to fail, as the buildpack used by default is SAP Java Buildpack 1.   To ensure compliance with this change, starting from the beginning of July, the MTA deployment will switch the default value for the buildpack parameter from sap_java_buildpack (SAP Java Buildpack 1) to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta (SAP Java Buildpack 2).  Action:  Plan and migrate your applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2 ahead of the scheduled change. In your deployment descriptors, you need to explicitly set one of the parameters buildpack or buildpacks of the java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee modules to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta. Note that this transition involves more than just configuration updates and may require code modifications.  See:  Migrate your Applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2  SAP Java Buildpack 2: Jakarta-Based, Fresh and New!  TomEE 10 has landed in SAP Java Buildpack 2!

Title: Update on Cloud Foundry API v2 Deprecation and Removal
Description: As announced on July 14, 2022, the Cloud Foundry API v2 is deprecated and replaced by the Cloud Foundry API v3. For more information on version 3, see https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org.  The usage of the Cloud Foundry API v2 is restricted by rate limits in the range of a few hundred requests per hour per user. Starting in April 2025, those limits will decrease over time and eventually reach zero in the first quarter of 2026. At that point, CF API v2 will not be available anymore.  Action:  You must migrate any direct usage of CF API v2 to CF API v3. For information on the migration, see https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#upgrade-guide.  If you’re using the Cloud Foundry command line interface (CF CLI) in version 7 or older, you must upgrade to CF CLI v8. See https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html.  If you’re deploying applications using the MultiApps CF CLI Plugin, you must update the plugin to the newest version. For more information, see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/multiapps-cli-plugin.  For more information, also see 3586830 .

Title: Root Certificate Replacement in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Environment
Description: As announced in SAP Note 3566727 on February 18th, 2025, the root certificate authority (CA) used to issue the certificates on SAP domains for the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment needs to be changed. The old CA "DigiCert Global Root CA G2" (G2) will be replaced by the newer "DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5" (G5). Clients of applications offered by SAP and of those operated by customers must add the new CA certificate to their trust store in order to ensure a seamless transition.  Action: Customers who use CTS+ to transport their MTAs into Cloud Foundry must import "DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5" (G5) from BTP Trust Store by the end of June 2025. The BTP Trust Store offers a current collection of Root CA certificates used by SAP BTP now and in the near future - see SAP Note 347221. For more information on how to import the certificates, see section 5.2 Import SSL Certificate in How To... Configure SAP Business Technology Platform, Cloud Foundry Environment for CTS.
