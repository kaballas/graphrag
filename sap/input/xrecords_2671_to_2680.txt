Title: Istio module: Update to version 1.7.0
Description:   This release contains Istio in version 1.21.3. For more details, read Istio 1.21.3 Release Announcement and Change Notes. See the changelog.  Now, you can opt out of the <ENABLE_EXTERNAL_NAME_ALIAS> Istio pilot environment variable in the Istio custom resource. This allows for retaining behavior that was present in Istio prior to version 1.21. See Istio Custom Resource Annotations.  We've added Request Authentication UI for Kyma dashboard.  Istio Operator does not restart Pods with the Istio sidecar that contain custom image annotations. See Resource Annotations.  We've changed Istio Ingress Gateway's scaling to be based only on CPU utilization. This adjustment ensures that the scaling is more responsive to traffic changes, as the Istio Ingress Gateway memory utilization is not a good indicator of the traffic load.  The default number of Istio Ingress Gateway replicas in smaller clusters is now set to 1.  We've introduced the compatibility mode, which allows you to mitigate breaking changes when a new Istio module's release introduces an Istio upgrade. The Istio module supports compatibility with the previous minor version of Istio. See Compatibility Mode.

Title: TLS 1.3 Support
Description: TLS 1.3, the latest version of the security protocol, brings significant improvements over TLS 1.2 by offering enhanced security, better performance, and increased privacy. Consequently, TLS 1.3 is planned to be enabled for all platform domains in the Neo environment by the end of June 2024. Furthermore, TLS 1.2 remains as a fallback option.  The following domains are adjusted:      *.<Region.Domain>      *.dispatcher.<Region.Domain>      *.cert.<Region.Domain>      *.static.<Region.Domain>      connectivitynotification.<Region.Domain>      connectivitytunnel.<Region.Domain>      For more information, see SAP Note 3435199 .  Action: During the transition period, until TLS 1.3 is fully enabled by the end of June 2024, we recommend you verify your clients by connecting them to the following URL (applicable for TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2): https://account.ca1.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome.
