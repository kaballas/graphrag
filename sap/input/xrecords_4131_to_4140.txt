Title: TLS 1.2 Cipher-Block-Chaining Ciphers Deleted
Description: As announced on September 21, 2023, the following TLS 1.2 Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) Ciphers have been removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment for the region ap11:    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384    Note that TLS 1.3 Cipher Suites are not affected by this change.  Action:  Older clients might be affected by this change. To maintain connectivity, please check and ensure that your clients are supporting one of the following TLS 1.2 ciphers that are still supported:     TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      After the deletion of the deprecated ciphers, requests from older HTTP client libraries that do not include any of the supported ciphers will fail during the TLS handshake. To verify that your client can connect without CBC ciphers, you can connect it to the following test application. If the client can establish a connection to the endpoint, the server returns the message ok along with a status code 200.  Endpoint with CBC disabled: https://tls12-no-cbc.ciphers.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com

Title: Release of the Serverless module
Description: Continuing on the path of modularizing Kyma, we are happy to announce that Kyma Serverless is now a module!   All the existing clusters have been migrated to have the module enabled without interruption. In new clusters, Serverless will not be enabled by default. Thus, users must enable it manually. To do that, check the Enable and Disable a Kyma Module tutorial.  The Serverless module features a new API - Serverless custom resource - which you can use to configure Serverless. For more details, see the Serverless configuration guides.  New versions of the Serverless module, with new features, bug fixes, or security patches, will be distributed to your Kyma runtimes using the release channels.  For more information on the Serverless module, check the Serverless module documentation.  We invite you to leave your feedback in the Serverless Manager GitHub repository.
