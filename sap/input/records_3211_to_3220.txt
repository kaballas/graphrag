Title: Removal of External Workspace Type
Description:   It's no longer possible to create an external workspace. When you create a new workspace, you can choose between creating a public workspace or a private workspace.  Existing external workspaces will become private workspaces and an External warning icon will be added to the workspace header to indicate that the content of this workspace is visible to external users.  You can invite external users to both private and public workspaces. To do that, when you create a new workspace (or when you edit the admin settings of an existing workspace), you need to choose the option "External users can access this workspace and be invited as members". Note that the invited external users should already be added to the system prior to the invitation. For more information about external users, seeAbout External Users  If the workspace setting "Allow users to request to join this workspace" is enabled, users can request to join this workspace by going to Workspaces  View All Workspaces   Explore Workspaces and clicking Join Workspace next to the workspace name. Alternatively, they can open the workspace and click the Join button at the top right.

Title: CSRF Protection for Dynamic Destinations
Description: Today our approuters do not provide CSRF protection for dynamic destinations. It’s assumed that backends behind the destinations, handle CSRF protection on their own.   New security measures have been introduced to enable CSRF protection by the approuter. This is done by setting the CEP.EnableCsrfProtection property to true for all dynamic destinations where their respective backend doesn’t handle CSRF protection.  If your backend is already protected, there’s no need to add this property.
