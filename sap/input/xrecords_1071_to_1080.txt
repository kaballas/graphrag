Title: Support for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification
Description: The service supports the authorization server issuer identification in the authorization code flow. The authorization code flow always includes the iss attribute in the response. The service exposes this support in the authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported metadata field.  A configuration option enables you to have the service reject responses from corporate identity providers which don't provide the iss attribute. If you want to implement OAuth 2.0 authorization server issuer identification (RFC 9207), make sure you validate the iss attribute.  For more information, see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207.
