Title: New parameter: Encoded JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) Array
Description: We have introduced a new parameter in the custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) configuration: Encoded JWKS Array (technical name: encodedJwksArray). With the JWKS specified, the OIDC authenticator skips the request to the issuer's jwks_uri endpoint to retrieve the keys.  The parameter is designed for scenarios where the OIDC metadata discovery endpoint (./well-known/openid-configuration) is inaccessible from the public internet, such as when the OIDC provider is behind a corporate firewall.  For more information, see OpenID Connect (OIDC).
