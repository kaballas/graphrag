Title: Pre-Production- Configurations API – Lock Configurations Against Changes
Description: There is a new endpoint called PATCH /configurations/{configurationId}/lock to flag a configuration as locked or not locked. The default setting is not locked. If a configuration is locked, it cannot be deleted, nor changed. For example, adding or removing a characteristic value or resetting the configuration is not possible.  Existing endpoints such as GET /configurations/{configurationId} will be enhanced to return the locked flag for a configuration.   The existing endpoint GET /externalConfigurations will be enhanced to allow searching for locked configurations.

Title: Istio module: Update to version 1.17.0
Description: We've updated the Istio version to 1.25.1 (#1365). Read the Istio 1.25.1 release announcement and Istio 1.25 Upgrade Notes.  This version of Istio includes changes to compatibility version parameters. See the parameters of the previous compatibility version switched from false to true:  ENABLE_INBOUND_RETRY_POLICY: If true, enables retry policy for inbound routes, which automatically retries any requests that were reset before reaching the intended service.  EXCLUDE_UNSAFE_503_FROM_DEFAULT_RETRY: If true, excludes unsafe retry on 503 from the default retry policy.  PREFER_DESTINATIONRULE_TLS_FOR_EXTERNAL_SERVICES: If true, external services prefer the TLS settings from DestinationRules over the metadata TLS settings.  ENABLE_ENHANCED_DESTINATIONRULE_MERGE: If enabled, Istio merges DestinationRules based on their exportTo fields. The DestinationRules are then kept as independent rules if the exportTo fields are not equal.  PILOT_UNIFIED_SIDECAR_SCOPE: If true, unified SidecarScope creation is used. This is only intended as a temporary feature flag for backward compatibility.  ENABLE_DEFERRED_STATS_CREATION: If enabled, Istio lazily initializes a subset of the stats.  BYPASS_OVERLOAD_MANAGER_FOR_STATIC_LISTENERS: If enabled, the overload manager is not applied to static listeners.    This compatibility version applies the following new parameter set to false:   PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE: If enabled, the pilot starts a controller that assigns IP addresses to ServiceEntry that do not have a user-supplied IP. When combined with DNS capture, this allows TCP routing of traffic sent to the ServiceEntry.    Note the significant changes announce with release 1.25.1 of Istio:   ISTIO_META_DNS_AUTO_ALLOCATE in proxyMetadata has been deprecated in favor of a newer version of DNS auto-allocation.  traffic.sidecar.istio.io/kubevirtInterfaces has been deprecated in favor of istio.io/reroute-virtual-interfaces.

Title: Root Certificate Replacement in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Environment
Description: Update: After an internal validation, the timelines have been shifted to Q1/2026. SAP will provide detailed dates in October 2025.  SAP is switching to the "DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5" and “DigiCert Global Root G3” PKI.  If you have systems in which you manage the trusted certificates yourself, check if the "DigiCert Global Root G2" certificate exists in them. If it exists and the usage is related to SAP BTP products, please add the new G5 and G3 certificates. Do not remove the G2 certificate yet, as it is needed during the transition period.  For more information, see 3566727  and SAP BTP Cloud Foundry: switching to higher security level Root Certificate Authority.
