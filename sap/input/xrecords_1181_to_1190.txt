Title: Release of the Cloud Manager module
Description: We are happy to announce that Cloud Manager is now officially released as a generally available module for SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.  The Cloud Manager module manages access to chosen resources and products of cloud providers. Once you add Cloud Manager to your Kyma cluster, the module securely brings the offered resources.  Cloud Manager is an optional module, which you can activate as required. By default, it is inactive when you create a new Kyma cluster. For details, see Add and Delete a Kyma Module.  For more information, see Cloud Manager Module. We appreciate your feedback or contribution to our GitHub project.

Title: Destination Service - Allowlisting of NAT IP Addresses
Description: Please take care to verify if you use the Destination service in a scenario where its NAT IP address is explicitly allowlisted.   This is relevant in situations where the Destination service makes calls to the configured target URL (Check Connection functionality in the UI) or to the configured token service URL (for the automated token retrieval of the OAuth flows).   Required Action  If you are making use of some IP allowlisting feature (such as this one from SuccessFactors), make sure you configure it to allow the new NAT IPs of the Destination service which come with our ongoing infrastructural migration.   The IPs can be found here: Configure Destination Service IPs in Firewall Rules.     Note  Some landscapes are not part of our current migration activities and as such are not yet on the list. For those landscapes, no action is needed currently.

Title: New Gorouter Log Field Added
Description: A new log field has been added to Gorouter. It will be visible in your application logs with source RTR: x_cf_true_client_ip and contains the IP address of the client that connected to the platform's load balancer.  As a user of SAP Application Logging service for SAP BTP, no action is required, as the log parsing is adjusted centrally. However, the field will not be available in the parsed log entries.  If you are using custom parsers behind an active syslog drain, you potentially need to adjust parsing rules and regular expressions. To update the parsing, find the new fields for RTR logs in your application logs, for example by using the CF CLI command cf logs | grep RTR and adjust any parser to fit the current order.  For general information about changes to RTR Logging Fields, see SAP Note 3433606

Title: Harmonization of HANA Compute Units (HCUs) to 16 GB Blocks
Description: One HANA Compute Unit (HCU) defines the block size for the SAP HANA Cloud database within an SAP BTP ABAP Environment system. The block size is 16 GB on both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. Previously, AWS had a block size of 15 GB, but this difference has been eliminated. Now, all regions use a standardized block size of 16 GB. Existing HANA Cloud databases on AWS have been updated to match this 16 GB block size.  See Creating an ABAP System.

Title: Destination Service - New Features
Description:   The Destination service REST API now allows to use an additional header to indicate that a specified fragment for the call is optional and the API should succeed and return the destination "as is" in case there is no fragment with the specified name.  Added a new filter when making "get all" calls to the REST API of the service, which allows to look up only the entities created or updated during the last n minutes. Where n is a value specified by the caller. The upper limit for n is 1 day.  You can now instruct the service to include certain metadata properties of the entity in the service response when making "get all" calls to the REST API.
