Title: Breaking change - cluster region mandatory for enabling Kyma runtime
Description: Within three months, the Region parameter will become mandatory for provisioning Kyma runtime in your cluster. The change affects all the available plans in the Kyma environment except for the Trial plan. Hence, if you have not used the parameter before, you must provide it now to ensure successful Kyma runtime provisioning.  When you enable your Kyma runtime, choose the region in your preferred interface:  In the SAP BTP cockpit, choose one of the regions from the menu.  In the SAP BTP command line interface, provide a cluster region name.    Choosing the region gives you control over where your Kyma runtime is provisioned.
