Title: Extension Concept – Skip Pricing Extension Implementations
Description: There are two new switches in the administration UI for non-productive tenants: One to ignore all custom implementations. The other one to ignore those custom routines that have not been implemented yet. If such switches are activated, custom requirements are evaluated as true, custom routines of other types are skipped, and the corresponding condition types do not get status inactive because of missing routine implementations.  See Administration Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Return Used Currency Exchange Rates
Description: Condition rates are either converted directly from condition record currency to document currency; or they are converted through triangular conversion first from condition record currency to local currency and then to document currency. The condition value is always returned in document currency. With a new request parameter for stateless pricing and document pricing, it will be possible to get the used currency conversion rates returned. This will allow the calling application to do own calculations in the same way.  See API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
