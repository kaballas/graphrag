Title: New Global URL
Description: Starting now, you can use the URL https://cockpit.btp.cloud.sap to access SAP BTP Cockpit (Feature Set B). Depending on your own geo location this URL will redirect you to the closest of the three regional Cockpit URLs (https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap, https://amer.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap, https://apac.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap).  You can also use deep links to get redirected directly to a specific page in the BTP Cockpit, for example, https://cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/cockpit#/globalaccount/<your-global-account>/accountModel.   Don’t worry - the regional Cockpit URLs we established recently, continue to work and we don’t plan to change that in the near future. The new global URL automatically chooses the best regional URL for you.  Note that these changes only apply to Cloud Management Tools Feature Set B. If you want to learn more about the differences between Feature Set A and Feature Set B, check out our help page on Cloud Management Tools - Feature Set Overview.
