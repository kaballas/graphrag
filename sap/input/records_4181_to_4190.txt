Component: Kyma Runtime
Environment: Kyma
Title: Deletion of the Cluster Users component
Description: The Cluster Users component has been deprecated since Kyma 2.7 and will be removed with Kyma 2.19. The component includes predefined Kubernetes ClusterRoles such as kyma-admin, kyma-namespace-admin, kyma-edit, kyma-developer, kyma-view, and kyma-essentials. These Roles specify permissions for accessing Kyma resources that you can assign to users. For example, if you bind a user to the kyma-admin ClusterRole, it grants them full admin access to the entire cluster, and if you bind a user to the kyma-view ClusterRole, they are only allowed to view and list the resources within the cluster. Once the component is removed, these Roles will no longer be available for newly created clusters. This means that you won’t be able to use these predefined sets of rights and will be required to specify yourself which users or groups should have access to which of your resources. However, for clusters created before the release of Kyma 2.19, the already-defined Roles will not be deleted.  Action: Learn how to Assign Roles in the Kyma Environment. After the deletion of the Kyma 2.19 release, you will be required to model access rights to Kyma resources yourself instead of using the predefined permissions provided by the Cluster Users component.
