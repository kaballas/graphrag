Title: Change of Default Credential Type to binding-secret
Description: We are going to make the following change for security reasons. The target audience of the change are developers.  If no credential types are defined in the application security descriptor, the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service applies a default. This default will be changed to binding-secret (instead of instance-secret).   Action  Check whether you are affected by the change. The change only affects new service instances (including reuse services) if all of the following prerequisites are true:      Allowed credential types are not configured in the security descriptor.      No parameters are passed during the creation of a binding or service key.      If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the binding-secret credential type before this change is activated. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the following credential types in the application security descriptor:    [binding-secret", "x509"]    It has the same effect as the planned change.    Recommendation  We strongly recommend to configure binding-secret and x509 as allowed credential types (or x509 alone) in conjunction with a regular credential rotation (see Service Instance Secrets).    For more information, see Application Security Descriptor Configuration Syntax.

Title: Creation and Update of xsuaa Service Instances Becomes Asynchronous by Default
Description: The target audience of the change are developers.  Currently, if the xsenableasyncservice attribute is not configured in your application security descriptor, the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service creates and updates service instances synchronously. This default changes to asynchronous. The change affects existing as well as new service instances of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service.  This change conforms with the new defaults of the Cloud Foundry command line interface (see https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/v8.html), which come with cf CLI v8.  Action  Check whether you are affected by the change. The change only affects you if the following prerequisite is true:        The xsenableasyncservice attribute is not configured in the application security descriptor.        If you are affected, ensure that your application works with asynchronous service instance creations and updates. This can easily be done by specifying the following attribute in the security descriptor before the change:  "xsenableasyncservice":"true"  It has the same effect as the planned change. Since asynchronous service instance creations and updates don't wait until the processing is finished, you may want to adapt the CF CLI commands in your deployment scripts so that they wait until completion:        cf create-service xsuaa application <service_instance> -c <security_descriptor_file> --wait      cf update-service <service_instance> -c <security_descriptor_file> --wait          Note  The --wait option is supported by Cloud Foundry CLI version 8 or higher.    For more information, see Application Security Descriptor Configuration Syntax.

Title: No Default Values for Redirect URIs in New Cloud Foundry Landscapes
Description: We are going to make the following change for security reasons. The target audience of the change are developers.  Currently, if you've deployed custom applications and if you didn't define redirect URIs in the application security descriptor (xs-security.json), the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service applies a default (https://*.cfapps.<landscape domain>). This default is going to be removed so that developers must configure the required redirect URIs in the application security descriptor.  Action  Check whether you are affected by the change. The change only affects new Cloud Foundry landscapes if all of the following prerequisites are true:        You haven't configured any redirect URIs in the application security descriptor of your application.      Your application authenticates users in a web browser.      You deploy your application to a Cloud Foundry landscape that has been made available to customers after the release note.        If you are affected, configure the required redirect URIs in the application security descriptor.  For more information, see Application Security Descriptor Configuration Syntax.

This will be changed so that the role collection will also be deleted from the subscriber subaccount.  Action  Be aware of this change.
