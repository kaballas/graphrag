Title: Vertical Layout in the Process Editor
Description: The vertical layout is now generally available.  These are some of the advantages that the new layout offers you:      To move process steps that have already been connected to the process, you simply select the step and drag and drop it.      You can access embedded help using the question mark button (?). In the Help Panel, you can navigate between the help for UI elements, the embedded What's New, and the Guided Tours.      If, for example, the outcome of an approval step in your process is “reject”, you can insert a go-to step and send users back to a previous step asking them to rework their entries.  See Use Cases for Custom Variables.      The side panel is wider and easier to work with. You can close it to save space. To display process information again, use the toggle button in the side panel.      You can select the next step to insert in your process from the smart menu.  See step 6 in Create a Business Process.      Steps with more than one flow are visualized as a group. You can collapse groups to get a better overview of the whole process.      The process is always valid, there are no more dangling ends. If you add a new step, for example, an approval form, all output paths are connected. You do not have to connect, for example, the Reject outcome to the process anymore.      See Create and Configure Forms in a Vertical Layout Process Editor.
