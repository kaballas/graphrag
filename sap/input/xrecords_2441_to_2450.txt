Title: Outbound SQL Using CDS External Entities
Description: With ABAP SQL as outbound service type, you can now access external databases using ABAP CDS and ABAP SQL. This feature is integrated into ABAP Cloud concepts, including CDS modeling of the external data sources, and natively uses SAP HANA federation capabilities (taking advantage of SAP HANA Smart Data Access). In this new dynamic access, you can model external data sources using the new CDS external entities and the new logical external schemas. The CDS external entities can be consumed using ABAP SQL. Dynamic external entities are the replacement of secondary database connections in ABAP Cloud. The available set of remote source types depends on the system type.  For more information, see CDS External Entities.
