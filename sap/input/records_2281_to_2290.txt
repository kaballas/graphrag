Title: Condition and skip update - changed behavior
Description: The behavior of target transformations that contain a combination of condition and skip operations for updates has been changed.  Previously, the skip operation was evaluated before the condition. If users or groups have been updated in the source system, they are marked as skipped in the logs, and Identity Provisioning does not proceed to evaluate the condition. As a result, users or groups that do not meet the condition are not deleted as they should be. After the change, the condition is evaluated first.  See: Transformation Expressions

Title: Reset of SAP Master Data Integration - changed behavior
Description: Resetting the SAP Master Data Integration source system also resets the delta load marker.  Previously, the reset cleared the operational data without resetting the delta marker. This approach prevented the provisioning of old events in subsequent job runs. Now, the reset procedure for this system is consistent with that of the other supported source systems.

Title: SAP Data Custodian - filter users by group display name
Description: The default write transformation is changed to support provisioning of users that are members of groups matching the set dc.group.prefix. This is possible by including a condition for filtering the users by group display name of their assigned groups. If the dc.group.prefix is set, only users assigned to groups that contain in their display name the set specific prefix will be provisioned. In case the property is not set, all users are provisioned to SAP Data Custodian, regardless of the group display name of their assigned groups.  For more information, see SAP Data Custodian (Target).

Title: Skip create and delete operations of groups - removed
Description: Skipping the create and delete operations for groups has been removed from the write transformations of the SAP BTP XS Advanced UAA (Cloud Foundry) target system.  Previously, it was not possible to create or delete groups; it was expected that groups already exist in the target system, allowing Identity Provisioning to only update their members. Now, creating, updating, and deleting groups follow the standard processes.  See: SAP BTP XS Advanced UAA (Cloud Foundry)
