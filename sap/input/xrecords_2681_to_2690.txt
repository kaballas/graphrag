Title: Create Subaccounts Based on an Existing Subaccount
Description: In the Account Explorer  page in SAP BTP cockpit, we've added a new option that allows you to quickly create a new subaccount based on an existing one, instead of creating it from scratch. The properties, labels, and service plan assignments can be copied from the existing subaccount to the new subaccount, after which you can continue to set up your new subaccount as needed.  You can access this feature from either the main Create   Create from Existing Subaccount button or the Create as New Subaccount option in the    (Actions) context menu of any listed subaccount.  This new option is available only on the AWS, Azure, or GCP region.  See Create a Subaccount from an Existing Subaccount [Feature Set B].

Title: Custom Export of Filtered Usage and Costs Data
Description: We've enhanced the spreadsheet data export feature in the Costs and Usage page in the cockpit. Now, you can choose to export only the data that is currently filtered in the main table, and to export data for just the current month.   In addition, you can choose any label names (keys) to be added as dedicated columns to the Subaccount Costs by Service and Actual Usage tabs in the spreadsheet.  To use these enhancements, look for the new Export  Custom option.  See Exporting Usage and Cost Data Information.

Title: Renamed Default Account Entity in Costs and Usage Page
Description: Some SAP BTP services report their billing and usage at the global account level, not at the subaccount level. Until now, such services were listed in the Costs and Usage page in SAP BTP cockpit under a designated account entity named DEFAULT_SA. Following your feedback, we’ve improved the clarity by renaming it to REPORTED-AT-GLOBAL-ACCOUNT-LEVEL.  Note  The subaccount ID remains unchanged (DEFAULT_SA) so that your existing scripts using the exported Microsoft Excel document remain compatible and won't require an update.  See Monitoring Usage and Consumption Costs in Your Global Account.
