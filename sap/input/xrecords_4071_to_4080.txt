Component: Kyma Runtime
Environment: Kyma
Title: Release of the NATS module
Description: We are happy to announce NATS as a new module for the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime. This module ships the NATS Manager, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a NATS JetStream deployment. It observes the state of the NATS cluster and reconciles its state according to the desired state.  NATS is an infrastructure that enables the exchange of data in the form of messages. JetStream is a distributed persistence system providing more functionalities and higher qualities of service on top of ‘Core NATS’. For further information about NATS and NATS JetStream, consult the Official NATS Documentation.  Kyma Eventing can use NATS as backend to process events and send them to subscribers.  NATS is an optional module, which you can activate as required. By default, it will be inactive when you create a new Kyma cluster. For details, see Enable and Disable a Kyma Module.  We invite you to learn more about NATS in Kyma and appreciate your feedback or contribution to our GitHub project.
