Title: Serverless module: Update to version 1.8.0
Description: Buildless Mode (beta): This version of the Serverless module introduces an optional buildless mode (beta), significantly reducing Function startup times by eliminating the image build and push step.  In buildless mode, Function code and dependencies are injected directly into Kyma-provided runtime images at Pod startup.  You can toggle on or off buildless mode by changing the Serverless configuration and choosing the best approach for your use case. For more details, see Serverless Buildless Mode.  Starting with the 1.9.0 release, buildless mode will be switched on by default, with the option to disable it manually. From the 2.0.0 version, buildless mode will be the only available option.  Localizable Serverless Images:Serverless runtime images can now be localized, enabling deployment in environments with restricted or private registries.  This enhancement improves flexibility and compliance for enterprise and regulated workloads.  Dedicated Network Policies:With version 1.8.0, users can enable dedicated Serverless network policies. This ensures Serverless remains functional on clusters with restrictive, deny-all network policies, improving security and compatibility for enterprise environments.  Deprecations/Breaking changes:The following fields, that were deprecated in the Serverless 1.6.0 release are no longer functional in buildless mode:    Function CRD  spec.scaleConfig – For existing Functions with scaleConfig defined, the HorizontalPodAutoscaler objects are not deleted upon switching to buildless mode, but are no longer managed by the Serverless module. To learn how to scale Functions, see Use External Scalers.  spec.resourceConfiguration.build    Serverless CRD  spec.dockerRegistry  spec.targetCPUUtilizationPercentage  spec.functionBuildExecutorArgs  spec.functionBuildMaxSimultaneousJobs  spec.defaultBuildJobPreset
