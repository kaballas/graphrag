Title: Java Connector 3.1.10.0 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Java Connector (JCo) version 3.1.10.0 provides the following bug fixes:      If a remote-enabled function module (RFM) has multiple TABLES parameters, the content of one or more received JCoTable objects could have been incorrect, all rows of affected tables being only partly filled.   In this case, each row was populated with data only up to a certain column and following fields were empty or contained their type-specific initial value. The full content of the first TABLES parameter was always correct.   This program error occurred under special complex preconditions, for which the affected TABLES parameters needed to have a certain layout structure of field types, while the affected table content was being transferred in compressed row-based serialization format.    Note  This was a regression bug which had been introduced with JCo 3.1.9.0        Changed values of property jco.destination.repository_destination, which were returned from the currently active DestinationDataProvider instance for a given destination name, were not processed correctly by the JCo runtime, and already existing JCoDestination instances for that destination name were not updated with the new value.   Such existing JCoDestination instances still returned the old JCoRepository instance, although a different one might be associated with the newly configured repository destination.      These issues have been fixed.

Title: HTML5 Business Solution as a Content Provider
Description: It is now possible to create an HTML5 business solution that behaves as a content provider in the subaccount.  The HTML5 business solution can be consumed by the local subaccount and also by remote subaccounts that access it via destinations.  To configure an HTML5 business solution as a content provider, the following actions are required:   Provider subaccount: the HTML5 code should be adjusted and include a cdm.json file that defines the design-time business content (for example, roles, groups, spaces & pages), and destinations.    Consumer subaccount: it is required to configure destinations that will point to the HTML5 business solution and create the content provider.
