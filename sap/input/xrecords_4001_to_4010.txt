Title: Failing Job in Case of an Invalid package.json File
Description: For a smooth Chromedriver update period, SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery tries to fetch the needed Chromedriver version from the package.json files that are part of the project. If one of these files had an invalid syntax, the connected jobs failed during the Init stage and showed a stack trace instead of a readable error message. Now, these jobs donâ€™t stop in the Init phase anymore and report the invalid package.json file as information only.

Component: Migration Assessment
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Extraction Status for Data Extractions
Description: Migration Assessment now displays the extraction status of a data extraction. The extraction status designates if the application encountered any warnings or errors during the extraction that might impact future evaluations of the data. If a data extraction finishes with warnings or errors, some data could not be extracted and might even not be used in the scenario evaluation. In these cases, see the extraction log for details and go back to your SAP Process Orchestration System and fix the issues before starting a new extraction.   Note that extraction status is not available for data extractions made before this software update. If you want to see the extraction status of data that was extracted before the update, you must create a new data extraction with the dataset.  See Concepts and Create a Data Extraction Request.
