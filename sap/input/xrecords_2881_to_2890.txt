Title: Enhancement to the service for Finland
Description: In the test and production environment, you can now register your Peppol participants using the new FI:OVT2 party ID type for Finland. The previous FI:OVT and the FI:VAT party ID types are now deprecated. Sending and receiving electronic invoices between participants that are registered in the Peppol network using the deprecated party ID types will discontinue to work in future.  If you have existing Peppol participants using the deprecated FI:OVT or FI:VAT as party ID type, you must delete those participants and create them again with the new FI:OVT2 party ID type.
