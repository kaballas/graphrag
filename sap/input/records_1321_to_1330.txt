Component: SAP Document AI
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Export and Import Feature for Documents Used with Instant Learning (Premium Edition)
Description: You can now export and import documents that you have edited and confirmed for use with instant learning.  Formerly, instant learning could use your feedback to enhance extraction results only in the client or instance in which you originally edited and confirmed documents. If you changed context, you had to reenter your feedback in the new context.  This new feature on the SAP Document AI basic UI allows you to quickly and easily export documents along with all information relevant for instant learning and import them for use in another context. As a result, you benefit from improved extraction results across different clients and instances, with no additional manual effort.  You can also forward the exported data to your support contact for troubleshooting.  See Export/Import Documents.
