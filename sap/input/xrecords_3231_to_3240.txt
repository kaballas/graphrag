Component: SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Mirroring of Partitioned Flag in Cookies for Sticky Sessions
Description: The __VCAP_ID__ cookie now mirrors the Partitioned flag from the JSESSIONID cookie that is used to activate sticky sessions on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime. This enables you to adjust your apps to the Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) partitioning model. You may need to do this to restore the functionality of sticky sessions for embedded content on Google Chrome, which is impacted by the stricter rules for cross-platform cookies that Google recently introduced.  Action:  If your app uses sticky sessions in combination with embedded content (like iFrame or AJAX/fetch requests), requests with embedded content may break if users access the app in Google Chrome.  To restore the functionality of sticky sessions for embedded content, you can now enable the Partitioned flag for your JSESSIONID cookie and adjust your app to follow the CHIPS model, in line with the approach suggested in the SAP Note 3409306  (Permanent Solutions section).  Details:  Sticky sessions on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime are activated by using the JSESSIONID cookie. This cookie is forwarded into embedded requests as well. With the stricter cross-platform cookie rules that were introduced for Google Chrome, such cookies must now be marked as Partitioned.  SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime uses the JSESSIONID cookie to derive another cookie, __VCAP_ID__. The __VCAP_ID__ cookie is used by Gorouter to pin requests from a particular user to the same application instance.  Prior to this release, the __VCAP_ID__ cookie did not mirror the Partitioned flag from the JSESSIONID cookie. Now the Partitioned flag will be mirrored, which enables you to use sticky sessions with embedded content following the new rules for cross-platform cookies.

Title: New Gorouter Log Fields Added
Description: Two new log fields have been added for Gorouter:    true_client_ip: for requests coming in through the Unified Gateway, the true_client_ip log field contains the public IP address of the client system from where the request originated      x_request_id: for each new request coming in through the Unified Gateway, the x_request_id log field contains the unique request id which is set and used by Unified Gateway for tracing requests      Action:  As a user of SAP Application Logging service for SAP BTP in the Cloud Foundry environment, no action is required. All new fields will be parsed automatically and can be used for troubleshooting.  If you are using custom parsers behind an active syslog-drain, you potentially need to adjust parsing rules and regular expressions. Find the new fields for "RTR" logs in your application logs, for example by using the CF CLI: cf logs <app-name> | grep RTR. Adjust any parser to fit the current order.  For general information about changes to RTR Logging Fields, see SAP Note 3433606 .
