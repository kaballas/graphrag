Component: Multitarget Applications for Cloud Foundry
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: General support for CF app features
Description: You can manage whether optional capabilities are enabled for a given Cloud Foundry application with the app-features module-specific parameter. It accepts a map as a value, where all elements in the map are passed directly to the CF API. This mechanism ensures that all future app features will be automatically supported through MTA deployment.  The parameter is especially useful when many services are bound to an application, and all credentials inside the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable exceed the maximum size of 130 KB (see Cloud Foundry environment variables). In this case, the application cannot be staged successfully. To solve that issue, you can switch to the "file-based VCAP services" method by enabling the respective app feature, and adapt your application coding accordingly to use a file instead of the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable. See Delivering service credentials to an app.  For more information about the parameter, see Module-Specific Parameters.
