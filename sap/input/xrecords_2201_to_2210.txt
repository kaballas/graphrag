Title: UI Improvements - Lobby
Description: We've made significant enhancements to the user interface within the lobby to improve your project management experience.   The key update includes:    Foldable Project Pane: You can now see detailed information and perform various actions directly from the foldable project pane. When you choose your project, it unfolds to provide access to a range of options.      Updated Versions Tab: Actions such as Publish to Library, Export, Save as New Project, and Transport have been moved under the individual versions of the project in the Versions tab. This change centralizes all version-related actions for easier access and better organization.      Enhanced Filter Search Criteria: The filter search options have been enhanced with additional fields, including Members and Systems. These new fields help you refine your searches more effectively, making it easier to locate specific projects or project details.      Clone from Git: The option to clone from Git has been moved under the Create button. This change makes it easier to start new projects by cloning from an existing Git repository right from the creation step.      Release: The release option has been moved from the lobby to the respective project editors. This change ensures that the release processes are managed within the project context, providing a more streamlined workflow.

Title: Condition and skip update - changed behavior
Description: The behavior of target transformations that contain a combination of condition and skip operations for updates has been changed.  Previously, the skip operation was evaluated before the condition. If users or groups have been updated in the source system, they are marked as skipped in the logs, and Identity Provisioning does not proceed to evaluate the condition. As a result, users or groups that do not meet the condition are not deleted as they should be. After the change, the condition is evaluated first.  See: Transformation Expressions

Title: Reset of SAP Master Data Integration - changed behavior
Description: Resetting the SAP Master Data Integration source system also resets the delta load marker.  Previously, the reset cleared the operational data without resetting the delta marker. This approach prevented the provisioning of old events in subsequent job runs. Now, the reset procedure for this system is consistent with that of the other supported source systems.
