Title: Role Assignment to Sites
Description: In the new Role Assignments screen, you can:    View all the roles assigned to the site.  Assign/unassign single roles (local and remote) that were added to the subaccount.  Assign/unassign content channels. This will result in assigning/unassigning all the roles from a given content channel. This is a new functionality that allows bulk assignment of roles instead of manually assigning them one by one.    Note    When assigning a channel, it’s not possible to select only part of the content channel roles.   Once a content channel is assigned, any change to its roles will automatically be applied to the site assignment.   You can only assign content channels that are set to automatic content addition.
