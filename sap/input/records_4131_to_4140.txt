Component: Identity Provisioning
Environment: Neo
Title: Changing users and groups update mechanism
Description: As of October 25, 2023, Identity Provisioning is changing the way users and groups are updated in the target systems.  The service will first apply the mapping of the entity unique attribute (most often userName for users and displayName for groups) and then will resolve conflicts if the entity exists in the target system. Currently, Identity Provisioning resolves the entity prior to applying the mapping of its unique attribute.  When the new mechanism is introduced, if the given mapping contains a function (for example, for removing a substring or concatenating a prefix), the service will handle it correctly. The entity wonâ€™t be skipped and will be properly updated.  Be aware that this change will affect you if you have the following three configurations in place:      The unique attribute is missing in the target transformation. Even if you've defined it as a property in <system_prefix>.user.unique.attribute or <system_prefix>.group.unique.attribute, it is still missing in the target transformation.      The skipOperation create is defined under the user or group resource in the target transformation.      The support for patch operations is enabled in the target system.      If you experience any issues when this change is introduced, make sure the unique attribute mapping is not missing in your target transformation. If this doesn't fix the issue, create a customer case to component BC-IAM-IPS. For more information, see Getting Support
