Title: Enhancements to the Costs and Usage page in SAP BTP Cockpit
Description: In the Costs and Usage page in SAP BTP cockpit, we've added the following enhancements:    When you drill down into the details of a service plan in the Billing tab (under the View by Service perspective) and the Usage tab, you can now see the subaccounts to which the plan is assigned in the context of your account hierarchy (under their respective directories). Until now, we listed the subaccounts in a flat list without directories.   You can now quickly expand and collapse the entire account hierarchy in both the main table and the details views.    See Monitoring Usage and Consumption Costs in Your Global Account.

Title: CSRF Protection for Dynamic Destinations
Description: Today our approuters do not provide CSRF protection for dynamic destinations. It’s assumed that backends behind the destinations, handle CSRF protection on their own.   New security measures have been introduced to enable CSRF protection by the approuter. This is done by setting the CEP.EnableCsrfProtection property to true for all dynamic destinations where their respective backend doesn’t handle CSRF protection.  If your backend is already protected, there’s no need to add this property.

Title: Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes - New Features
Description: Transparent Proxy version 1.5.0 provides the following new features:      The Transparent Proxy module in Kyma now automatically detects and integrates with the Connectivity Proxy module, reducing the need for manual configuration.   For more information, see Transparent Proxy in the Kyma Environment.      Transparent Proxy supports the Destination Fragment feature, allowing for the extension of a destination with a fragment. The destination fragments themselves enable more flexible technical connection configuration management for the solution administrators. Now, using the Transparent Proxy, you can easily consume target systems defined as destination-fragment pairs.   For more information, see Extending Destinations with Fragments and Destination Fragments.      Transparent Proxy now supports a new integration with Connectivity Proxy in the so-called multi-region setup. This allows you to link the multi-region related configuration between the two components, resulting in simplified consumption at runtime.   For more information, see Connectivity Proxy Integration.
