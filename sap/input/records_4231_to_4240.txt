Title: Root Certificate Replacement
Description: DigiCert has deprecated their DigiCert Global Root CA and will stop issuing certificates for SAP under any of its Intermediate CAs (ICA) at the end of 2023. This includes the ICA that is currently used as issuer of the SAP BTP, Neo environment platform certificate. For more information, see https://knowledge.digicert.com/generalinformation/digicert-root-and-intermediate-ca-certificate-updates-2023.html.   SAP BTP Neo environment switches to the G2 ICA and will deploy certificates signed by the new CA for all platform domains starting in October 2023. This means that the DigiCert Root CA platform domain certificate will be signed by DigiCert Global Root G2 instead of DigiCert Global Root CA.  The following platform domains are affected:    *.<Region.Domain>      *.dispatcher.<Region.Domain>       *.cert.<Region.Domain>       *.static.<Region.Domain>       connectivitynotification.<Region.Domain>       connectivitytunnel.<Region.Domain>      For an overview of all region domains, see: Regions and Hosts Available for the Neo Environment.   Action: It is possible that older clients or operating systems do not trust the new root CA, which can cause certificate validation or handshake errors. Within the transition period, we recommend that you verify that your clients trust DigiCert Global Root G2.

Title: Upcoming Deletion of TLS 1.2 Cipher-Block-Chaining Ciphers
Description: As announced on September 8, 2023, the following TLS 1.2 Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) Ciphers are scheduled to be deleted from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment for the region eu20 on October 19:      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256  TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384      Note that TLS 1.3 Cipher Suites are not affected by this change.  Action:  Older clients might be affected by this change. To maintain connectivity, please check and ensure that your clients are supporting one of the following TLS 1.2 ciphers which are still supported:    TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      After the deletion of the deprecated ciphers, requests from older HTTP client libraries that do not include any of the supported ciphers will fail during the TLS handshake. To verify that your client can connect without CBC ciphers, you can connect it to the following test application. If the client can establish a connection to the endpoint, the server returns the message ok along with a status code 200.  Endpoint with CBC disabled: https://tls12-no-cbc.ciphers.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com
