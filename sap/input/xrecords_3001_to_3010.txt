Title: Extension Concept - Provide More Data to Requirement Implementations
Description: The pricing engine used to only pass parameters attributes and exclusioIndicator as input data to requirement implementations.  This is still the default behavior, but through a projection on fields of structure itemInput in COLLECT ATTRIBUTES' response via extendedInput>documentInput>itemInput>projection it is now also possible to request the item quantity and other conditions information for a requirement formula.  For a requirement formula, it is only possible to retrieve a subset of the conditions field for the already determined pricing conditions:    stepNumber      counter      conditionType      conditionRate      conditionUnit      scale      See API Definition and Extension Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: SAP Cloud ALM Integration for Performance Monitoring
Description: The Real User Monitoring start page, which should provide an overview of all service requests, was hard to read because a very large number of individual requests was listed. This happened due to some IDs in the paths of the requests that could not be aggregated at the endpoint level. This issue has been corrected by replacing such IDs with an asterisk. With that, now you see aggregations such as /api/v1/pricing/documents/*/conditions/* or /api/v1/pricing/documents/*/items/* instead of individual requests per document id, item id, or condition id.  See Administration Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Stateless Pricing - Enable SAP CPQ to Work With Alternative Units of Measure
Description: In pricing results, the condition rates are returned as maintained. Only condition values are returned in the target document currency based on the itemâ€™s target quantity and unit of measure. To help SAP CPQ to cope with condition rates that use alternative units of measure, the item condition details of endpoint POST /api/v1/statelesspricing is enhanced with a new field conditionRateNormalized, which also considers the target currency and the sales unit of measure.   This field is for use in SAP CPQ only and may change becoming incompatible at any time when requested by SAP CPQ. Do not use this field in any other integrations.  See API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Support Data Determination Access Type C - KOMPAZAD
Description: Data determination at condition access level was previously not supported by the Pricing service. This also meant that the Pricing service did not consider condition record fields with access type C Data Field from Condition Table  This gap has been closed. The Pricing service supports the determination of fields in the structure KOMPAZD in an access and their use for the condition determination in a subsequent access.
