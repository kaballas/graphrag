Title: Telemetry module: Update to version 1.19.0
Description: The new version brings the following improvements:      Logs, Metrics, and Traces: To save resources and avoid stress on configured backends for invalid setup scenarios, if the gateway or agent configuration for all pipelines of a signal type cannot be generated, no gateway or agent becomes active. For example, when a TLS certificate expires, the related gateway or agent is removed and no data is tried to be pushed to the configured backend (#298).      Logs, Metrics, and Traces: CRD validation checks whether every TLS certificate has the required key (#1205).      Logs: If the unsupported mode isn't active, kubectl list views show it as false (#1179).
