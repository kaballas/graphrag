Title: Global References for API Artifact
Description: In addition to including local resources within your API artifact, such as database connections or configuration files, you can also make use of reusable message mappings, which allow you to define standardized mappings between different message formats. Script collections, on the other hand, provide a library of pre-built scripts that can be easily reused across multiple API endpoints. Message type libraries and function libraries offer a centralized repository of message types and functions that can be shared and utilized throughout your API development process.
