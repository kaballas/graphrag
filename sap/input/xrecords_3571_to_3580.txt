Title: Offline supports OData generated draft key values
Description: (Version 2401) Mobile Services offline now supports key properties that were skipped over or missed when default values were generated by the back-end OData service (Version 4 only), including object entries, and referential constraint definitions that contain partial primary keys. For primary keys that are not referenced by foreign keys, a server-side default value is used. This enables Mobile Services to process Cloud Application Programming (CAP) draft entities for offline. Previously this level of integration was not supported.  See     Defining Offline Settings for Applications      Creating and Deleting Entities

Description: There are two new switches in the administration UI for non-productive tenants: One to ignore all custom implementations. The other one to ignore those custom routines that have not been implemented yet. If such switches are activated, custom requirements are evaluated as true, custom routines of other types are skipped, and the corresponding condition types do not get status inactive because of missing routine implementations.

Title: Return Used Currency Exchange Rates
Description: Condition rates are either converted directly from condition record currency to document currency; or they are converted through triangular conversion first from condition record currency to local currency and then to document currency. The condition value is always returned in document currency. With a new request parameter for stateless pricing and document pricing, it will be possible to get the used currency conversion rates returned. This will allow the calling application to do own calculations in the same way.  See API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
