Title: Application Connector module: Update to version 1.1.0
Description: The new release of the Application Connector module contains a new service, Compass Runtime Agent, which was previously installed with Kyma runtime. From now on, it will be fully modularized and loaded on demand with the other Application Connector module components, allowing you to save computing resources.  This change is aligned with the new control plane architecture where Kyma runtime is registered in Compass only when the Application Connector module is added.  This release also contains multiple security updates.
