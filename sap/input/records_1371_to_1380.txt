Title: Owner Visibility in Key Properties
Description: The Document Management Service, Application Option now displays the owner of the document under the Key Properties tab instead of labeling them as Administrator in the Access Control tab. This update helps you add or update the owner’s name as an Access Control List (ACL), which then propagates to subfolders and documents.   Previously, the owner appeared as an ACL principal in the application UI, which confused users regarding the difference between the owner and the ACL. By relocating the owner details to the Key Properties tab, we enhance clarity around the object owner and the associated ACLs, thereby improving the overall user experience.

Title: Restructuring of Documentation
Description: The documentation has been restructured to consider different scenarios for integrating and activating processes.  When you first integrate a process with your business system, you need to perform all the required integration steps as described in the documentation. However, when your business system is already integrated with the cloud edition and you want to activate additional processes, you can now directly access the new Process-Specific Configuration section, which describes the configuration steps that are specific to enable the communication with external communication parties.
