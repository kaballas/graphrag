Title: Java Connector 3.1.9.0 - Enhancements
Description: Release of Java Connector (JCo) version 3.1.9.0 provides the following enhancements:        JCo 3.1.9.0 now supports SapMachine 21.      WebSocket RFC client communication has been improved by adding a ping/pong packet exchange mechanism for keeping WebSocket RFC connections alive while waiting for an RFC response from the communication partner. Hence, an underlying TCP/IP network connection should not get closed anymore by firewalls or other network devices due to a potential network traffic idle timeout while waiting for long running requests being processed on the WebSocket RFC communication partner server side.  Corresponding ping periods and pong timeouts are configurable.   Find more details about the new properties jco.destination.ws_ping_period and jco.destination.ws_pong_timeout in Target System Configuration (Cloud Foundry environment).
