Title: Change of Image Size Limitation
Description: Until now, any image file larger than 5MB (1024*1024*5 pixels) was rejected when uploaded to the image widget and it wouldn't be recognized as an image when uploaded to workspace content.  With the new behavior, for images uploaded to the Content folder, a preview is available for images up to 20MB. Above 20MB, a preview will not be available. For images uploaded directly to the image widget, 20M is the new size limit.

Title: Mapping Cards to Destinations
Description: Administrators can now map cards to destinations.  After creating a new content channel that contains cards, the administrator must map any destinations defined in the cards to runtime destinations defined in the SAP BTP cockpit.   To do this, use the Map Aliases option, located in the Status column of the channel in the Channel Manager, and map the destinations in the Cards Aliases tab (new).  Note that the mapping is required for new content channels. Existing channels will continue to work with no further actions.

Title: Migration of AWS Kyma runtime workers to IMDSv2 access method
Description: What do you need to know?  Following the updated security policy, the Kyma service is obliged to disable the IMDSv1 access method on all existing and new AWS Kyma runtimes and enable IMDSv2 as the only access method instead.  The change schedule:    2024.08.07: Enable the IMDSv2 access method on new AWS Kyma runtimes      2024.08.10-11 Major Upgrade Window: Migrate existing AWS Kyma runtimes to the IMDSv2 access method      As part of the migration, new workers are created with the IMDSv2 access method only, and the existing worker nodes are drained (application Pods are evicted) and removed. To minimize disruption to your workloads, we recommend you ensure availability by running multiple replicas across different Availability Zones and configuring Pod Disruption Budgets.  What do you need to do?  Most Kyma users should not be affected by this change as your workloads do not directly integrate with the EC2 IMDSv1 API. However, you are affected if you access EC2 IMDSv1 API from your Kyma workload(s) without a token. In such a case, you must change your workloads to use the IMDSv2 access method before the scheduled changes.  See the official AWS documentation for more details.

Title: API Gateway module: Update to version 2.4.1
Description: The release 2.4.1 of the API Gateway module introduces the new, entirely Istio-based v2alpha1 version of the APIRule CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) and custom resource (CR). The new version of the APIRule CRD is a significant step towards a stable API Gateway API.   Version v2alpha1 includes the following changes:  The APIRule authorization policy is now based solely on Istio and the APIRule CRD no longer supports the Ory Oathkeeper authorization policy.  Access strategies are now limited to jwt and noAuth, with plans to support extAuth in the future. You can find more information about the strategies in the access strategies documentation and the ADR for the extAuth access strategy.    Now, both versions of APIRule custom resources are supported. The APIRule CR in version v1beta1 will become deprecated in 2024 once we finish extending its configuration. Currently, we’re working on adding the extAuth access strategy, which might be a migration path for oauth2 handlers based on Ory Oathkeeper. When the time comes and we announce the deprecation, you'll see a What's New note with a detailed migration procedure. For now, we encourage you to learn more about the new version and follow the APIRule tutorials.  The new version is not backward compatible with v1beta1.  Besides that, this release includes the following changes:  Ory Oathkeeper's scaling is now based only on CPU utilization. This adjustment ensures that the scaling is more responsive to traffic changes, as Oathkeeper memory utilization is not a good indicator of the traffic load.  We've fixed rendering of APIRule list when multiple APIRule CRs exist.
