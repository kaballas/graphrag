Title: Consistency Check Adjustment
Description: As of now, the consistency check confirms whether a user group assigned in the task list template contains any users. If a user group is empty, the consistency check issues a warning message for now, allowing you to continue with task list generations.

This error will then prevent you from generating task lists.  More information:  How to Perform Checks on Templates  App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: Ensure that you don't have empty user groups. Pay special attention to the warning messages raised for empty user groups and address the changes required.  For information about how to run a consistency check, see How to Perform Checks on Templates.
