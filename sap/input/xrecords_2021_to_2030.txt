Component: SAP Document AI
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Create and Manage Schema Versions on the SAP Document AI Basic UI
Description: You can now use the SAP Document AI basic UI to create and manage versions of schemas.  Using schema versions means that you no longer have to copy or adapt existing schemas for broadly similar use cases that differ only slightly in terms of the data fields involved and the associated settings.   After configuring, saving, and activating a new schema, you can create additional versions by adding and removing fields and changing settings, as needed. These changes don’t affect the original schema, which remains as version 1.  See Use Schema Versions.

Title: API Gateway module: Deprecation of APIRule v1beta1
Description: To improve and optimize our services, the APIRule CustomResourceDefinition version v1beta1 will be gradually phased out. The deprecation phase will start on October 28, 2024. APIRule v1beta1 version will be deleted on May 12, 2025. To make sure you can smoothly migrate your APIRule custom resources (CRs) to the stable version v2, you can start testing version v2alpha1 and provide feedback before the migration window opens. Version v2alpha1 is intended for testing purposes only, helping you evaluate the new version’s compatibility and functionality. It is not recommended for use in production environments. By testing APIRule v2alpha1 in advance and providing feedback, you can help us further refine this version, ensuring that the formal upgrade will have minimal impact on your operations. The migration process does not disturb any existing applications.   We expect version v2alpha1 to be promoted to version v2 without significant changes. The release of version v2 is planned for April 15, 2025. After that, you will be required to complete the migration from version v1beta1 to version v2 by May 12, 2025.  Recommended action: We strongly recommend that you test the migration process in a non-production environment using version v2alpha1. This will not only help you familiarize yourself with the new features but also allow us to optimize the migration experience and apply your feedback.  Required action: During the migration window lasting from April 15, 2025 until May 12, 2025, you must migrate your production APIRule CRs to version v2.   For detailed migration steps and timelines, see the blog posts on the APIRule migration for the noAuth and jwt handlers and APIRule migration for the ORY Oathkeeper-based OAuth2 handlers.
