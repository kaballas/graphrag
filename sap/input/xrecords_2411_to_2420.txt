Title: ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse: ATC Checks now Support List of Classic APIs
Description: Should released APIs for ABAP Cloud be missing, the ABAP Extensibility Guide recommends creating a custom API wrapper. The ATC checks “Usage of Released APIs” and “Usage of Released APIs (Cloudification Repository)”, which are classic APIs that are recommended to be used in a wrapper, were adjusted. If you're using a SAP BTP ABAP environment system as your central ATC check system, no ATC error is shown in case an API classified as classic is used in custom code. Instead, you’ll only receive a warning.
