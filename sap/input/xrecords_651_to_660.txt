Title: New Custom Trusts for Platform Users Changed to Token-Based Authentication
Description: With this release, new OpenID Connect (OIDC) trust configurations between your SAP BTP accounts and custom identity providers for platform users are configured to use token-based authentication instead of password-based. We've taken this step to improve security and compliance with the OIDC standard. There are no changes to existing trust configurations. We don't expect any impact for our customers. For more information, see Establish Trust and Federation of Custom Identity Providers for Platform Users.

Title: Entitlement Management Improvements for Standard Plan
Description: We've improved the entitlement management functionality for SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime:  You can now manage entitlements for the standard plan, which is automatically assigned to all subaccounts by default. This means that if you want to restrict the usage of this plan, you can unassign it from a subaccount. For more information, see Restricting the Usage of Standard Plan for Cloud Foundry Runtime.  Additionally, if your global account uses the consumption-based commercial model, you can now change the default runtime memory quota of 200 GB that is automatically assigned to a subaccount. For more information, see (optional) Adjusting Runtime Memory Quota for Cloud Foundry Runtime (Consumption-Based).  These improvements give you more flexibility, but they don't affect the overall process for setting up the Cloud Foundry environment in a subaccount. For more information, see Initial Setup.  For an overview of the plans available for SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime, see Service Plans and Metering for Cloud Foundry Runtime.  Note  Currently, these improvements are unavailable in certain regions, such as China (Shanghai) and Government Cloud (US). We're planning to gradually make them available in all regions at a later point in time.

Title: Cloud Connector 2.18.1 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.18.1 provides the following bug fixes:    When installing the Cloud Connector on Windows, the installer no longer ends with a failure "secsetpasswd: Invalid password" within scc_service.log.  A cause exception similar to Caused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: class com.sap.scc.util.LogUtils (in unnamed module @0x2d019f4f) cannot access class sun.security.validator.ValidatorException (in module java.base) can no longer occur, when running the Cloud Connector with SapMachine 11, 17, or 21.  In a shadow instance, the message "LDAP changes will not take effect unless Cloud Connector is restarted" will now be shown only if the LDAP configuration has indeed been changed.  After an upgrade of an instance using both, a separate HA (high availability) port and multiple LDAP instances, the LDAP configuration did not work anymore. The previous configuration got corrupted and as a consequence, the trace was wrongly showing "Unable to determine whether password should be changed for user sccadmin".  Alerts about a successful switch of roles are now no longer popping up again after having deleted these alerts. This was a regression in 2.18.0.  The setting for user OID mapping for client certificate authentication did not survive a restart, it was stored and shown correctly in the UI. However, for the logon always "CN" was used again after a restart.  After an upgrade, an email configuration that used TLS, lost its TLS attribute. This was a regression in 2.18.0.  The upgrade now ignores corrupted zip files (for example, file size 0) in the log directory so the Cloud Connector can be started properly after an upgrade.  Fixed a wrong authorization check, see also SAP security note 3611345.

Title: Cloud Connector 2.18.1 - Enhancements
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.18.1 provides the following enhancements:    The JVM parameters NewSize, MaxNewSize, SurvivorRatio, and TargetSurvivorRatio were dropped, as the G1 garbage collector works better without those settings.  Introduced a new monitoring API /exposed?action=ensureMasterRole which behaves similarly to /exposed?action=hasMasterRole, but also signals the lack of the master role through a HTTP response status code of 409.For more information, see: Monitoring APIs.      The Cloud Connector now shows the IPv6 status on the About screen.
