Title: Node.js 18 is reaching end of life
Description: Node.js 18 is reaching end of life on April 30, 2025 according to the Node.js Roadmap. It will stay available for a short time after that, and then will be removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. When this version disappears, deployment and redeployment of Cloud Foundry applications running on Node.js 18 will fail.   Action: We strongly recommend that you migrate your applications to Node.js 20 or 22 as soon as possible.   In exceptional cases (if you haven’t managed to switch to Node.js 20 in time), to avoid application failures during redeployment, you can pin the last buildpack version that contains Node.js 18, as provided by the nodejs-buildpack community. To learn how, see: Specify a buildpack version  If you are using MTA deployment descriptors, in your mtad.yaml file you need to define module type javascript.nodejs and set parameter buildpack to nodejs_buildpack. For example:    modules:- name: myapp  type: javascript.nodejs  parameters:    memory: 512M    buildpack: nodejs_buildpack    If you want to pin a particular buildpack version (for example, 1.8.34), you can do it the following way:    modules:- name: myapp  type: javascript.nodejs  parameters:    memory: 512M    buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack.git#v1.8.34    To learn more, see MTA Module Types.   NOTE: SAP does not recommend use of Node.js 18 after its end-of-life date as no support and security fixes will be provided for this version anymore.

Component: Authorization and Trust Management Service
Environment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other
Title: Deprecation of the instance-secret Credential Type for Service Instances
Description: We are going to make the following changes for security reasons. The target audience for the change are developers.  If credential types are defined in the application security descriptor, the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service accepts the following values:        instance-secret      binding-secret      x509        The value instance-secret is deprecated with immediate effect.  Runtime changes are not yet applied. We are going to announce these changes later.    Recommendation  Instead of using the instance-secret credential type, applications and services should use the binding-secret credential type (see Migrate from Instance Secrets to Binding Secrets) or x509 (see Retrieving Access Tokens with Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)).    For more information on the security descriptor, see Application Security Descriptor Configuration Syntax.

Title: Deprecation of the xsenableasyncservice Element for Service Instances
Description: The target audience for the change are developers.  The xsenableasyncservice element in the application security descriptor is deprecated with immediate effect.  Runtime changes are not yet applied. We are going to announce these changes later.    Recommendation  You are affected if you explicitly use the xsenableasyncservice element in your security descriptor.If you use the element with the value true, you can remove it without any impact.If you use the element with the value false, you need to ensure that your application or service works with asynchronous service instance creations and updates. See also Creation and Update of xsuaa Service Instance Becomes Asynchronous by Default.    For more information, see Application Security Descriptor Configuration Syntax.

Component: Application Autoscaler
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: End of support for the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme (basic auth) when using the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API for security reasons
Description: We are going to make the following change for security reasons. The target audience of the change is developers:   The credential type will only be configurable to x509 (instead of x509 or binding-secret).  Creation of new bindings with the credential-type binding-secret will fail.  Action    Check whether you are affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       The credential-type parameter is set to binding-secret during the creation of the binding.      If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change.  For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.  Until 2025-04-30 you may configure the credential-type to binding-secret, to restore the previous configuration.
