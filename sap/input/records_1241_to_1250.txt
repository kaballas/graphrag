Title: More Meaningful Extraction Confidence Ranges for Custom Fields Extracted Using Generative AI (Premium Edition)
Description: SAP Document AI now provides more meaningful extraction confidence ranges for custom header fields for which extraction is handled by generative AI.  Formerly, if you extracted information from custom header fields with the setup type auto and no default extractor, SAP Document AI displayed a moderate extraction confidence range until you entered feedback on the results.  Now, the service determines the extraction confidence for such fields more accurately by checking whether the data type of the extracted information matches the data type for the respective field in the schema.  See View and Edit Extraction Results.
