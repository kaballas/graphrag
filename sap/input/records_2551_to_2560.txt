Title: Cloud Connector 2.17.1 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.17.1 provides the following bug fixes:      The subaccount authentication data expiration was not calculated correctly and reported as expired, even if still valid.      Regressions in 2.17.0:        LDAP secure host flags (Secure Host and Secure Alternate Host) were neither stored in the LDAP draft configuration nor in the final configuration when pressing the Save Draft or Activate button.      On the subaccount overview page, the region host could have been shown as not reachable with message Proxy could not be reached, even though the subaccount is shown as connected and there is no proxy in use. Productive connections were not affected.       Adding a subaccount was not possible, if BTP is reached only via a proxy and the proxy returns an unexpected status code on check.       CPIC trace files were neither shown nor downloadable from the UI.       The Open Shadow button at the top of the High Availability screen did not result in any action.       If adding an RFC SNC access control entry without load balancing logon, the virtual port had an additional 's' at the end. Such an entry could not be used from the cloud side.         These issues have been fixed.
