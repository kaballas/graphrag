Title: Recommended Use of New Reporting Apps
Description: In February 2024, four new reporting apps were released offering reporting data in Task View apps and Organizational Unit View apps.  Task View apps offer reporting based on the task overall status, while Organizational Unit View apps offer reporting based on the task execution status of each organizational unit. Additionally, Organizational Unit View apps allow you to perform reporting based on company code groups, independently of country/region assignments.  Remember  For these new apps, the following new static role templates are available that need to be assigned to users so they can access the new apps:  For the Task View apps: AFC_ReportingTaskView  For the Organizational Unit View apps: AFC_ReportingOrgUnitView    These apps are accompanied by the Manage Company Code Groups app that allows you to create, edit, and delete company code groups to support reporting based on task execution level.  Recommendation  Use the new reporting apps for task lists released as of February 18, 2024.  More information:  Reporting on Task Execution and Task Overall Level  Apps affected:  Financial Close Overview (Deprecated)  Closing Task Completion (Deprecated)  Financial Close Overview - Task View  Closing Task Completion - Task View  Financial Close Overview - Organizational Unit View  Closing Task Completion - Organizational Unit View  Manage Company Code Groups    Action: If you haven't done so yet, start using the new reporting apps offered as Task View apps and Organizational Unit View apps.

Description: You can now deactivate tasks to exclude them from future task lists generated from the template. This allows you to keep tasks in the task list template including all settings, assignments, and dependencies, while still excluding them from task lists generated from the template. You can later reactivate tasks to include them in future task lists again.  Additionally, the Task Activation Status information has been introduced in relevant places in the Manage Closing Task Lists app as field or column respectively.  Furthermore, deactivated tasks appear differently in the dependency graphs. Instead of a solid line as frame, they have dashed lines:î‡•  For now, the task activation status for all existing tasks has automatically been set to Active, so that they're still included in task lists you generate as of now.
