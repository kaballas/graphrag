Component: SAP Advanced Financial Closing

Title: Closing Structure Table Change in Upcoming Release
Description: With the release planned to be made available in February, a second tab will be added to the Closing Structure table. While the Hierarchy tab will display the closing structure as a hierarchy (that is, the way you already know it), the new List tab will show the folders in a list.  This change will affect the personalized views (formerly known as view variants) that you have created for the Closing Structure table. Due to this change, the existing views will be lost with the February release and will need to be recreated afterwards if still required.  Note  Views will be managed separately on both tabs. This means that you will be able to create views specific to one of the tabs without the view appearing in your view management on the other tab.  App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: Take note of the views you're currently using. Once the release planned for February is available, go to the Closing Structure table in the Manage Closing Task Lists app and recreate and save the views if they are still required.

Title: Vertical Layout in the Process Editor
Description: The vertical layout is now generally available.  These are some of the advantages that the new layout offers you:      To move process steps that have already been connected to the process, you simply select the step and drag and drop it.      You can access embedded help using the question mark button (?). In the Help Panel, you can navigate between the help for UI elements, the embedded What's New, and the Guided Tours.      If, for example, the outcome of an approval step in your process is “reject”, you can insert a go-to step and send users back to a previous step asking them to rework their entries.  See Use Cases for Custom Variables.      The side panel is wider and easier to work with. You can close it to save space. To display process information again, use the toggle button in the side panel.      You can select the next step to insert in your process from the smart menu.  See step 6 in Create a Business Process.      Steps with more than one flow are visualized as a group. You can collapse groups to get a better overview of the whole process.      The process is always valid, there are no more dangling ends. If you add a new step, for example, an approval form, all output paths are connected. You do not have to connect, for example, the Reject outcome to the process anymore.      See Create and Configure Forms in a Vertical Layout Process Editor.
