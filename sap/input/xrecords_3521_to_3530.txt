Title: Cloud Connector 2.16.2 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.16.2 provides the following bug fixes:    Multiple issues were fixed for configuring certificate-based authentication:  Authentication was no longer working after an upgrade from 2.16.0 to 2.16.1, because the configuration was modified wrongly during the upgrade.  Authentication was no longer working after changing LDAP settings, because the configuration was modified wrongly when persisting the LDAP changes.  The list of trusted certificates could not be adjusted anymore after activating certificate-based authentication.    Compatibility mode in bgRFC for sending units to old SAP NetWeaver 7.01 systems contains dummy RFC_PING invocations to reflect some constraints in such a scenario. The Cloud Connector, however, required RFC_PING to be part of the access control list and hence did not automatically allow it, like it should be for such infrastructure-related, remote-enabled functions. This issue could occur in IBP integration scenarios.  The proxy check could wrongly indicate that the HTTPS proxy is not reachable.  A vulnerability could occur in the Cloud Connector due to improper checking of certificates.For more information, see SAP security note 3424610 .     These issues have been fixed.
