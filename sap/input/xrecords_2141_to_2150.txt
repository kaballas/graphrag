Component: SAP BTP Administrator's Guide
Environment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other
Title: Introducing the SAP BTP Administrator's Guide
Description: We’ve improved the documentation structure to more effectively meet the needs of our users:   What was formerly known as “Best Practices for SAP BTP” is now targeted towards administrative tasks and best practices, providing a more streamlined resource for administrators. It has therefore been renamed to SAP BTP Administrator's Guide.  All our recommendations about developing applications, some of which used to be part of the Best Practices as well, have been consolidated in the SAP BTP Developer’s Guide.   This restructuring aims to ensure that both developers and administrators can easily find relevant and specialized guidance.

Title: Changes to the SAP Document AI Basic UI
Description: We’ve made a number of enhancements to the SAP Document AI basic UI.       When you upload a document and choose it on the Documents screen, you now see the extraction results for header fields and line items alongside the document preview, without first having to click Extraction Results.      In the extraction results, you can now use the filters at the top of the Edit pane to set which extraction confidence ranges to display. You can select either a single range or all of them.      When using the Template feature, you can now edit and confirm extraction results for the associated document by choosing it on the details page for the template you've created.      Also on the Template details page, you can now set an extraction method for individual fields or for all fields your template. The available methods are Template and AI.      See View and Edit Extraction Results, Add Documents and Activate/Deactivate Template, and Add Template.

Title: New Instant Learning for Information Extraction Using Generative AI (Premium Edition)
Description: SAP Document AI now allows you to enhance extraction with generative AI by using your edited extraction results to enrich the prompt to large language models (LLMs) with user feedback.  If you use an appropriately configured schema, SAP Document AI learns from your feedback as soon you commit documents with edited extraction results. As a result, information extraction is improved for relevant fields in all subsequent documents.  To use this feature, you must first activate it using the configuration key enableInstantLearning.  See Instant Learning (Premium Edition) and Configuration Keys.
