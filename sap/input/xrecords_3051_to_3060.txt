Title: Consistency Check Status Handling
Description: The consistency check statuses have been updated. During this change, the existing statuses were renamed, an additional one was added, and some rules that define which status is set were changed slightly. The consistency check statuses are now as follows:    Status  Description of the Change        Successful  Replaced the status OK, following the same rules.      Successful with Warnings  Newly introduced to cover checks that issue warnings but no errors.      Failed  Replaced the status Not OK (please recheck), but now only covers checks that have errors.      Check Required  Replaced the status Not OK (never checked), but now also covers the case of a template that previously had a successful check but has undergone changes since then.      Additionally, an enhancement has been implemented: Sorting and filtering has been enabled for columns that display the consistency check status.  More information:  How to Perform Checks on Templates  In-app help    App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: Since sorting and filtering on the status information has been enabled, the Consistency Check Status column needs to be re-added to views that used to include the column. For more information about how to work with views, see How to Manage Views.

Title: Consistency Check to Be Extended in Upcoming Release
Description: In the release planned to be made available in June, the consistency check is planned to be extended by one further check regarding user assignments. As of then, the consistency check will also check whether users assigned to tasks, folders, or on header level have been deleted. If the check detects any deleted users, messages are raised and may cause the consistency check to fail due to errors. The following logic will be applied:  If a deleted user is assigned as the user responsible, processing user, or remote processing user, the consistency check fails. No task list generation is possible.  If a deleted user is assigned as an interested user, the consistency check is successful, but it shows warnings. Task list generation is possible.  If a user group consists only of deleted users and is assigned as the responsible user group or processing user group, the consistency check fails. No task list generation is possible.  If a user group consists only of deleted users and is assigned as an interested user group, the consistency check is successful, but it shows warnings. Task list generation is possible.    A consistency check for all templates will automatically be triggered when this enhancement is released, and the status will be set accordingly.  App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: In preparation for this upcoming change, you can already check your task list templates for assignments of deleted users in roles that would cause the consistency checks to fail. This way, you can prevent the consistency checks from failing after the release of this enhancement. To check for such assignments, do the following:  In your task list template, check the assignments on header level for deleted users:  Still on header level, go to Tasks.  In the corresponding user assignment columns, check for the value ***. This will show you users who have been deleted.    In the Closing Structure table of your task list template, do the same to check assignments on folder level.

Title: Deletion of Back-End Data
Description: When you delete task list templates or task lists referring to on-premise systems, the affected data is marked for deletion in the corresponding communication system. The final deletion, however, is managed by the communication system based on the ILM configuration. This deletion in turn can happen only for data that has been marked for deletion.Note  Your on-premise communication system needs to fulfill specific requirements for the Marked for Deletion indicator to be available. If these requirements are not met and the Marked for Deletion indicator accordingly isn't available, SAP Advanced Financial Closing will keep a reference to the data until the communication system fulfills the requirements and the data can be marked for deletion.For more information about the requirements, see System-Dependent Feature Availability.  More information:  How to Delete Task List Templates and Task Lists  System-Dependent Feature Availability    App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: If you're using SAP Advanced Financial Closing with a connected on-premise system, check whether your communication system fulfills the requirements to mark data used by SAP Advanced Financial Closing for deletion.
