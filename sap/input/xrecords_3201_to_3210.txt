Title: Third Party Cookies Deprecation
Description: Starting from April 1st 2024 third-party cookies will be restricted on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This restriction can block the access to content that runs in the site iframe and doesn’t use SAP-managed domains such as ondemand.com or cloud.sap. Namely, it will affect non-SAP content, sites that are using a full custom domain, and sites that are using a standalone appRouter such as in the case of a launchpad module.  To avoid this situation, customers can apply to participate in the first-party deprecation trial, and request Google to issue them a token that will temporarily re-enable third-party cookies until December 27th, 2024”. For more information, see Request more time to prepare with the third-party cookie deprecation trial for top-level sites.  Action:  If affected, customers should get familiar with the deprecation trial program and request a token from Google. Once the token is issued, they should open a support ticket on component EP-WZ-DMN and provide SAP the token details.  Official SAP Note: 3409306 .
