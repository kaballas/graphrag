Title: Condition and skip update - changed behavior
Description: As of September 24, 2024, Identity Provisioning will change the behavior of target transformations that contain a combination of condition and skip operations for updates. For example: Code Syntax  "condition": "$.groups empty false",
"skipOperations": ["update"],   Currently, the skip operation is evaluated before the condition. If any users or groups have been updated in the source system, they are marked as skipped in the logs, and Identity Provisioning does not proceed to evaluate the condition. As a result, users or groups that do not meet the condition are not deleted as they should be.  Following the change, the condition will be evaluated first. Users and groups who do not match the condition will be skipped. After the condition is evaluated, the skip operation will determine whether the remaining users will be skipped or provisioned.  See Transformation Expressions.

Title: Read and proxy read transformation changes
Description: The mapping which omits the display of groups under the user entity is removed from the default read and proxy read transformations of the Identity Authentication and Local Identity Directory connectors. This makes possible filtering users by groups display name when using condition in the target system.  See Identity Authentication and Local Identity Directory.
