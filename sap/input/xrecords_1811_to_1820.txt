Component: Kyma Runtime
Environment: Kyma
Title: Telemetry module: Update to version 1.28.0
Description: The new version brings the following improvements:      Traces: You can now filter out Istio traces properly thanks to the noise filter of the trace gateway that was adjusted to trace changes in Istio (#1612).      Metrics: New MetricPipeline resources now have the subselectors of the runtime input enabled out of the box which means that when you enable the runtime input, all metrics are collected by default (#972).      Metrics: As the annotation-based scraping of Pods running with an Istio sidecar cannot work by design, it is now explicitly not supported. The recommended way to do the scraping is by using annotations on a related service (#1468).      Logs: Improved resource configuration of the log agent no longer triggers CPU throttling alerts in third-party observability solutions (#1601).      New labels to use for telemetry workloads in NetworkPolicies when you enable the communication of your workload with the Telemetry module components (#1516).
