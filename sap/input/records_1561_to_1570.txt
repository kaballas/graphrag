Title: Provisioning sub-attributes of emails attribute
Description: Changes in the read transformations of Identity Authentication (version 1 and 2), Local Identity Directory, and SAP Ariba Invoice Management ensure that Identity Provisioning now reads all sub-attributes of the emails attribute as defined in the SCIM core schema (that is, value, type, primary, display).  Changes in the write and proxy write transformations of Identity Authentication (version 2) ensure that users with multiple email addresses are provisioned with the correct primary email.  For more information, see Identity Authentication (Source), Identity Authentication (Target), Identity Authentication (Proxy).

Title: Reduced Set of Scopes for Credentials of Cloud Identity Services Instances
Description: When you create a new binding or service key for a service instance of Cloud Identity Services with the application plan, the generated credential only has the following scopes depending on the credential type:      Certificates: OpenID and Identity Directory for Applications.      Secrets and JSON Web Key Sets: OpenID.      If the application needs additional scopes, such as Application or Application Users, the tenant administrator must explicitly grant them.  For more information about configuring client credentials, see Configure Secrets for API Authentication.  For more information about using SAP Cloud Identity Services with SAP BTP, see Integrating the Service with the Identity Service of SAP BTP.
