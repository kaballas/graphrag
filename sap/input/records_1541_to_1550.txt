Title: Production - Configurations API – Raise Conflict for Non-Unique Inferences from Multiple Rows of a Variant Table
Description: When a characteristic value could not be set because a selection on a variant table resulted in more than one row, an exception used to be raised and the configuration service endpoint prompted an error. This behavior has been changed by not raising an exception anymore but signaling a conflict in the configuration results in the same way as LO-VC does it.

Title: Production – Configurations API –Exclude Globally Assigned Characteristics from Configuration Results
Description: In certain scenarios, characteristics are assigned to classes and products only for internal purposes, for example, if they are used in object dependencies but not assigned to a class of the product. These so-called globally assigned characteristics are now filtered out in the service responses and are not persisted anymore with the configuration results. They can still show up in the configuration engine trace.
