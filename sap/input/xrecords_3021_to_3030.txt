Title: Changing totalResults attribute calculation mechanism
Description: Identity Provisioning changed the mechanism for calculating the total count of users or groups returned by proxy systems when executing a SCIM Proxy endpoint request to read entities from a backend system.  As of now, if the backend system provides the actual value of the totalResults attribute and there is no condition defined in the read mapping transformation of the proxy system, this value will be returned in the response from the Identity Provisioning implementation of the Proxy System SCIM API.  Previously, the value of totalResults attribute was the sum of the request parameters startIndex and count. This calculation mechanism remains unchanged for backend systems which do not provide value for the totalResults attribute.
