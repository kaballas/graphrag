Title: Extensions Concept – Pass the Variant Factors to Extension Implementations
Description: Variant condition keys are passed to extension implementations using the corresponding pricing attribute. The variant factors returned by the Variant Configuration service with each key used to be missing. Through a projection on the fields of structure itemInput in the response of the action COLLECT_ATTRIBUTES via extendedInput->documentInput->itemInput->projection now it is also possible to request variantKeyFactors.  See Extension Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Graduated Interval Scales Factor
Description: When doing Pricing with Graduated Scales, a factor per scale level is calculated and applied to calculate the condition value from the condition rate. This factor used to overwrite the value of the duration factor in the response field conditions-durationFactor. This loss of information has been corrected by returning this factor separately in the new response field conditions-graduatedScaleFactor.

Title: Price Agreements
Description: There are new endpoints to create, change, read, and delete so-called price agreements. With price agreements, the calling application can overwrite the condition rates and scales of condition types on pricing document items. This will enable the new tier pricing feature in SAP CPQ, where the sales agent can negotiate prices and scales with the customer during the quotation process.  See API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Proper Return of Used Currency Exchange Rates
Description: Condition rates are either converted directly from the condition record currency to the document currency; or they are converted through triangular conversion, first from the condition record currency to the local currency, and then to the document currency. The condition value is always returned in the document currency.   With a request parameter for stateless pricing and document pricing, it is possible to get the used currency conversion rates returned. This allows the calling application to do its own calculations.  In the currency conversion response items->currencyConversions->localCurrencyToDocumentCurrency, the exchange rate provided used to be from the document currency to the local currency, instead of from the local currency to the document currency. This issue has been corrected.  See API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
