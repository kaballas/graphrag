Component: Multitarget Applications for Cloud Foundry
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Enhanced Configurability for Managed Service Updates
Description: Updates of managed service instances are now more configurable with the introduction of the fail-on-service-update parameter. Typically, these updates are fail-safe by default in certain scenarios, such as when updating parameters (when service brokers are involved) or when a plan update triggers an asynchronous operation. You can now change this behavior by using the fail-on-service-update parameter in cases where the fail-safe behavior is not desired.  See Resource-Specific Parameters.
