Title: Deactivation of Tasks
Description: You can now deactivate tasks to exclude them from future task lists generated from the template. This allows you to keep tasks in the task list template including all settings, assignments, and dependencies, while still excluding them from task lists generated from the template. You can later reactivate tasks to include them in future task lists again.  Additionally, the Task Activation Status information has been introduced in relevant places in the Manage Closing Task Lists app as field or column respectively.  Furthermore, deactivated tasks appear differently in the dependency graphs. Instead of a solid line as frame, they have dashed lines:î‡•  For now, the task activation status for all existing tasks has automatically been set to Active, so that they're still included in task lists you generate as of now.
