Component: SAP Dynamic Forms
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Release 2509
Description:     Object number added to MAIF linkage table:  To help you easily identify which object a form is attached to, the object number has been added to the SAP Dynamic Forms linkage table in MAIF, /SMFND/D_FORMREG.      Support for populating dropdown dataset from Form Instance XML:  Using MAIF's pre-processing, Form Instance dropdown controls can now be initialized with S/4 data.      Support for passing user information into offline forms in SAP Service and Asset Manager:  By using the XPath formula xxf:user-name(), the user's email address can now also be passed into an offline form when filling it out in the SAP Service and Asset Manager application. This allows you to identify internal and external employees on the form.      In the Form Categories app, the Form Version field is now optional.

Schedule:  BTP Live Middle East regions: 2025-10-17 17:00 - 21:00 UTC  BTP Live Asia Pacific & Japan (APJ) regions: 2025-10-18 14:00 - 17:00 UTC  BTP Live Europe regions: 2025-10-18 21:00 - 24:00 UTC  BTP Live Americas regions: 2025-10-19 06:00 - 09:00 UTC    For more information on the upcoming release, see the feature highlights, deprecations, and removals in the blog post and the Kubernetes release notes.  Note: As part of the migration, new workers are created, and the existing worker nodes are drained (application Pods evicted) and removed. To minimize disruption to your workloads, it is advisable to ensure the availability of your applications by running multiple replicas across different Availability Zones and configuring Pod Disruption Budgets.  Note: The v1 Endpoints API is now officially deprecated (though still fully supported). The API will not be removed, but you should start using the EndpointSlice API instead.

Component: Multitarget Applications for Cloud Foundry
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: REMINDER: Introduction of Readiness Health Checks
Description: Starting at the end of September 2025, MTA deployment in Cloud Foundry will support Cloud Foundry readiness health checks by introducing new module-specific parameters:  readiness-health-check-http-endpoint  readiness-health-check-type  readiness-health-check-invocation-timeout  readiness-health-check-interval    Users may encounter problems during MTA deployment if the parameters readiness-health-check-<XYZ> are already defined in their MTA descriptor but are incorrectly configured. In such case, the MTA deployments will start to fail with the error message: None of the instances of the app <app-name> become routable. Please verify that the defined MTA parameters for the readiness health check align with the app's code and configuration.  Action: Review your MTA descriptors and verify the related readiness health check configurations to ensure correctness. To prevent issues when enabling readiness health check support in MTA deployment, follow the guidelines in SAP Note 3625631 .
