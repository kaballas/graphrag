Title: API Gateway module: Update to version 2.2.0
Description: Version 2.2.0 of the API Gateway module brings the following changes:    We've introduced PodDisruptionBudget for Ory Oathkeeper. For more information, see the PR.      We've extended APIRule access strategies with no_auth to restrict accessible methods, thereby minimizing the exposure of the API.      Now, the Kyma modules use consistent labeling. To learn more about the labels that the API Gateway module uses, see Labeling Resources.      The API Gateway custom resources (CR) use the Warning state instead of Error when there is more than one APIGateway CR on the cluster. For more information, see the PR.
