Title: Hide Empty Spaces and Pages in the SAP Fiori Launchpad
Description: Spaces and pages are not shown when they are empty because of the user's role context. This feature is opt-in, so it's disabled by default. The launchpad setting SPACES_HIDE_EMPTY_SPACES_PAGES  is set to the default value false that can be changed in the Manage Launchpad Settings app. Note  SAP plans to activate this feature by default with the upcoming 2505 SAP BTP ABAP environment release. You can now try it out and inform your users, if necessary, about a potential change of behavior.With the 2508 release, the setting will be removed from the Manage Launchpad Settings app, and empty spaces and pages will continue to be hidden by default.  For more information, see Empty Spaces and Pages Not Displayed.
