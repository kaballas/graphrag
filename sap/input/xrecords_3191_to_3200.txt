Title: Enhancements to Joule in SAP SuccessFactors
Description: We’ve made the following enhancements:  When you view someone's information, if there's only one match for the name, their information is now displayed directly without the need for confirmation. Previously, your confirmation was required before viewing their information.    In the use cases "View peers", "View direct reports", and "View manager", inactive users are now removed from the search result. Previously, they were displayed.      In the "Create spot award" use case, if users upload an oversized image for the spot award program, as a workaround, it is automatically replaced by a default image without affecting the award creation. Previously, awards with oversized images couldn’t be successfully created.

Title: API Gateway module: update to version 2.3.0
Description: Version 2.3.0 of the API Gateway module brings the following changes:    We’ve added conditions to the API Gateway status. To learn more, see API Gateway Custom Resource.      We’ve fixed the user interface for the mutators’ configuration.      We’ve fixed the handlers’ validation in APIRules. As a result, you are not allowed to use the noop access strategy with any other access strategy. You also must not use secured access strategies (such as jwt, oauth2_introspectio, oauth2_client_credentials, or  cookie_session) with unsecured access strategies (for example, allow, no_auth, noop, unauthorized, or anonymous).

Title: Third Party Cookies Deprecation
Description: Starting from April 1st 2024 third-party cookies will be restricted on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This restriction can block the access to content that runs in the site iframe and doesn’t use SAP-managed domains such as ondemand.com or cloud.sap. Namely, it will affect non-SAP content, and sites that are using a full custom domain.  To avoid this situation, customers can apply to participate in the first-party deprecation trial, and request Google to issue them a token that will temporarily re-enable third-party cookies until December 27th, 2024. For more information, see Request more time to prepare with the third-party cookie deprecation trial for top-level sites.  Action:  If affected, customers should get familiar with the deprecation trial program and request a token from Google. Once the token is issued, they should open a support ticket on component EP-WZ-DMN and provide SAP the token details.  Official SAP Note: 3409306 .
