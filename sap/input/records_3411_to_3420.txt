Title: Connectivity Proxy for Kubernetes - Kyma Integration
Description: As previously announced (February 26, 2024), on-premise connectivity in the Kyma environment will be handled by a Kyma module called connectivity-proxy.   This module is now available and can be activated by customers. The result is backward-compatible to the previous built-in solution, but the activation involves a short migration downtime (see previous announcement). Note  Keep in mind that all remaining users using the previous solution will be migrated centrally on March 16 within the announced maintenance window.  For more information, see On-Premise Connectivity in the Kyma Environment.

Title: Destination Service - New Feature
Description: A new entity called destination fragment has been introduced. Each fragment is a key:value pair and is used to extend and override the properties of a destination at runtime.   This lets you avoid configuration duplication by keeping common properties within a destination and extracting various specific properties into dedicated fragments. At runtime the application can decide which fragment to apply to the base destination, based on the particular scenario.   You can use destination fragments through the Destination service REST API.  For more information, see Destination Fragments.
