Title: Kyma CLI purpose revisited
Description: After introducing the modular architecture in Kyma, we had to revisit the purpose of its CLI.  We noticed that many v2 commands are not helpful in the modular Kyma setup. Additionally, some v2 commands targeted module developers but did not target the actual Kyma users. That's why we decided to revisit the strategy for Kyma CLI.  We have released the last patch for the v2 version and deprecated all Kyma CLI v2 commands.  A new version (v3) with a whole new set of commands (targeting users of both open source and managed Kyma) will be developed and first introduced within an alpha command group.
