Title: Telemetry module: Update to version 1.35.0
Description: The new version brings the following improvements:      Traces and Metrics: Update to OTel Collector 0.120.0 (#1873).  With this update, the internal metrics of the collector have been aligned with the Prometheus conventions: The naming of the metrics was adjusted with suffixes and units, and instrumentation scopes have been added. This change does not have any impact on the health monitoring of the Telemetry module.  Recommended Action: If you are accessing the internal metrics endpoints directly, you must adapt your approach. If you cannot adapt right away, use the temporary annotation telemetry.kyma-project.io/internal-metrics-compatibility-mode: true - for details, see Telemetry CRD: Annotations.      Logs: Update to Fluent Bit 3.2.7 (#1876).

Title: More Meaningful Extraction Confidence Ranges for Custom Fields Extracted Using Generative AI (Premium Edition)
Description: SAP Document AI now provides more meaningful extraction confidence ranges for custom header fields for which extraction is handled by generative AI.  Formerly, if you extracted information from custom header fields with the setup type auto and no default extractor, SAP Document AI displayed a moderate extraction confidence range until you entered feedback on the results.  Now, the service determines the extraction confidence for such fields more accurately by checking whether the data type of the extracted information matches the data type for the respective field in the schema.  See View and Edit Extraction Results.
