Component: Kyma Runtime
Environment: Kyma
Title: Serverless module: Update to version 1.5.0
Description: Following the deprecation note published on 30th of October, 2023, we are removing support for namespace-scoped custom Docker registry configurations.  In addition, the new version introduces changes in the management of Function resources. We have changed the default preset for the requested resources for Function builds. Now, it demands less CPU time by default. Related to that, we have exposed the resource-related configuration in Kyma Dashboard.  We have also added support to ESM syntax in the Node.js Functions. This allows you to pick whether to include the dependencies using the import/export or require (...) statement. Follow Sample Functions to learn how to toggle between EMS and CommonJS.
