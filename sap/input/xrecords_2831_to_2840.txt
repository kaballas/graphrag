Title: Introduce Templates for Integration Dependencies
Description: When creating integration dependencies, you can use templates that are based on different use cases:      Blank template  You write integration dependencies from scratch inluding the aspects that contain a set of APIs and/or events of a system that define the dependencies other systems need to comply with to be able to be part of an integration scenario together.      Simplified Business Eventing template  Integration dependencies are exposed as available event subscriptions in SAP Event Broker. This template helps you write simplified integration dependencies that identify the types of events a subscribing application wants to consume. Here's an example. Let's say SAP SuccessFactors publishes a set of events. You want to receive a subset of those events. You can use the Simplified Business Eventing Template to identify the event types that SAP Event Broker makes available to your subscribing system.      See Declaring System APIs and Events as Dependencies for Business Scenarios.

Title: Java Connector 3.1.9.0 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Java Connector (JCo) version 3.1.9.0 provides the following bug fixes:      Setting numeric string values into fields of type BCD with method JCoRecord.setValue([name|index], String) resulted in a ConversionException if the numeric string used scientific notation with an exponent. The same ConversionException occurred when deserializing such strings for field type BCD from JSON input data via method JCoRecord.fromJSON([Reader|String]).    Setting decimal number values into fields of type BCD with method JCoRecord.setValue([name|index], BigDecimal) did not throw a ConversionException if the fraction part of the provided java.math.BigDecimal value had too many digits to fully fit into the BCD field. The BigDecimal value was rounded and stored in the BCD field nevertheless. Thus, the provided value's precision was lost unnoticed.      If a JCoFunction uses a TABLES parameter with compatibly-extended metadata having appended additional columns compared to the parameter metadata used on RFC communication partner side, the first additional field of each transferred row could contain NULL-bytes and/or garbage characters. The occurrence of this program error depended on the table row's field structure and whether alignment bytes are required for internally organizing the table content data or not.        These issues have been fixed.
