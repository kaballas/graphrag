Title: Static Upscaling of SAP HANA Cloud Instances
Description: It's now possible to scale up the SAP HANA Cloud instance of an SAP BTP ABAP Environment system via the SAP BTP Cockpit and via API calls. The related settings are size_of_persistence for compute power or main memory and size_of_persistence_disk for the disk size of the SAP HANA Cloud instance of the system. Updates are carried out without a restart of the HANA Cloud instance by using a temporary replica database followed by a takeover to this database as the new database. The takeover requires a reconnect of the ABAP application servers to the new database, terminating all ABAP applications running at that specific point in time.
