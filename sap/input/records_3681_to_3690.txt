Title: Serverless module: Update to version 1.3.0
Description: We are excited to announce the release of the Serverless module 1.3.0. This version includes improved resiliency and introduces a fully declarative mode for defining Functions by removing the Serverless admission webhook workload and embedding the x-kubernetes-validations rules into the Function Custom Resource Definition. We have also fixed a bug causing out-of-memory errors during the creation of large Functions and prevented caching of arbitrary Secrets & ConfigMaps to avoid controller crashes. In addition, trace span names are now preserved for the same Function's generations to ensure easy observability.

Title: Offline supports OData generated draft key values
Description: (Version 2401) Mobile Services offline now supports key properties that were skipped over or missed when default values were generated by the back-end OData service (Version 4 only), including object entries, and referential constraint definitions that contain partial primary keys. For primary keys that are not referenced by foreign keys, a server-side default value is used. This enables Mobile Services to process Cloud Application Programming (CAP) draft entities for offline. Previously this level of integration was not supported.  See     Defining Offline Settings for Applications      Creating and Deleting Entities
