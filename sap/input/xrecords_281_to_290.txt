Title: Reduce Footprint of Business Configuration Maintenance Objects
Description: With the existing RAP generator for business configuration maintenance objects, you can easily generate all development objects that are required for a configuration object. Since the number of objects is still quite large, optimizations in the RAP programming model have been implemented that reduce the number of required development objects and make them easier for a developer to manage.  For more information, see Creating Business Configuration Maintenance Objects.

Title: Reduction of Technical Downtime for Hotfix Collection Imports
Description: A new update procedure reduces the technical downtime during the installation of hotfix collections in a non-development SAP BTP ABAP environment system. These new procedures split the update process into three phases: a preparation phase, a short takeover phase, and a postprocessing phase. The preparation phase installs the updated software version into a shadow layer of the system. The takeover phase switches to the new software version. As part of the takeover, running ABAP applications are terminated and new sessions will start on the new software version. This takeover induces a short downtime of the system in the area of seconds up to a minute. Finalization tasks and clean-up steps run in the postprocessing phase. Both the preparation phase as well as the postprocessing phase run in the background during uptime of the system. Some lifecycle management activities, like the import of transports or tenant creation, are blocked during the preparation phase. These downtime improvements become effective with the first hotfix collection update of the 2508 release.

Title: Reduction of Technical Downtime for Release Upgrades
Description: New upgrade procedures reduce the technical downtime during the installation of new releases in a non-development SAP BTP ABAP environment system. These new procedures split the upgrade process into three phases: a preparation phase, a short takeover phase, and a postprocessing phase. The preparation phase installs the new platform release into a shadow layer of the system. The takeover phase switches to the new platform version. The switch to the new platform release happens within a shortened downtime of 20 to 40 minutes. Finalization tasks and clean-up steps run in the postprocessing phase. Both the preparation phase as well as the postprocessing phase run in the background during uptime of the system. Some lifecycle management activities, like the import of transports or tenant creation, are blocked during the preparation phase. These new procedures were already applied during recent upgrades, but will become even more beneficial with the planned system-specific announcement of precise technical downtime. In the first phase, we provide this feature to production systems running on 4 or more HANA Consumption Units.

Title: SAP Fiori Launchpad: Manage Launchpad Spaces and Pages: Redesign and Renaming
Description: In the SAP Fiori launchpad, both the Manage Launchpad Spaces and Manage Launchpad Pages apps were redesigned. We adapted the overview pages to enhance working with spaces and space templates, as well as with pages and page templates. "Predefined" and "SAP-Delivered" were renamed to "Templates" to ensure consistent terminology between these apps, the Maintain Business Roles app and the ABAP Development Tools for space and page templates.  See Manage Launchpad Spaces and Manage Launchpad Pages.

Title: SAP Fiori Launchpad: New Layout for Launchpad Shell Bar and Menus
Description: The layout of the SAP Fiori launchpad shell bar, user menu, notifications list, navigation menu and user settings was changed according to the current SAP Design System. The user experience was harmonized across different SAP products. The navigation menu was enhanced and is now part of the shell bar. It now offers access to My Home, Favorite Apps, My Spaces and All Spaces.   The sorting options in the notifications list were simplified. In addition, there is a new button to directly open the settings from here. The order of entries in the user menu as well as in the user settings has been adapted.  See User Menu, Shell and Shell Bar and Working with Notifications.

Title: Server-Sent Events in ABAP HTTP
Description: The ABAP HTTP client and server now support server-sent events (SSE). Which allows a server to send parts of the body of the response to the client without the client having to actively request them. After being sent by the server, the client can fetch them as they become available.  For more information, see Enabling Server-Sent Events.
