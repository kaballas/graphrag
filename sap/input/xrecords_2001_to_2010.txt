Title: New Parameter in btp CLI for Listing Only Authorized Subaccounts
Description: We've added a new --authorized parameter to the btp list accounts/subaccounts command in btp CLI, which allows you to filter only the subaccounts that you have access to. If you omit this parameter, the command prints all the subaccounts in the global account.  See https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-cli-command-reference/btp-list-accounts-subaccount.

Title: Cloud Connector 2.17.2 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.17.2 provides the following bug fixes:    The connection check for access control entries could fail even if the connection would work fine in productive usages. This was caused by a changed default value introduced in Tomcat 9.0.90. With the upgrade to Tomcat 9.0.95, the problem has been solved. This was a regression in 2.17.1.  When upgrading a shadow instance, the master high availability (HA) port got lost during the upgrade. This was a regression in 2.17.1.  Pressing CapsLock when entering a password into Cloud Connector's login screen deleted the password characters that were entered so far. This was caused by a regression in UI5 Core 1.108.30 that was used in 2.17.1.  In the connection monitor details view the active requests were not showing the user that is invoking the service, even if the user is actually known. This was a regression introduced in 2.16.0.  Due to a faulty consistency check, the custom regions list contained all the known regions that were in use on the Cloud Connector. This illegal state has been corrected.  When using a dedicated HA port and resetting the HA settings on a shadow, the shadow's UI port within the HA information was wrongly set to the HA port. As a consequence, after connecting again to a master, it was not possible to open the shadow UI using the button in the master UI in the High Availability screen.

Title: Cloud Connector 2.17.2 - Enhancements
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.17.2 provides the following enhancements:    Introduced a CapsLock warning on all password input fields. Previously, such a warning was only shown on the login screen.  Cloud Connector does no longer allow to upload UI certificates from a P12 file that include the KeyUsage certsigning. Such certificates are not accepted by all browsers for identifying a server.  The connection check for access control entries is now allowed for all authenticated users.  When opening TCP connections successfully, an audit log entry is written that access to the system has been allowed.
