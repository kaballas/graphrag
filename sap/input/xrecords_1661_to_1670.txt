Title: Java Connector 3.1.11.0 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Java Connector (JCo) version 3.1.11.0 provides the following bug fix:  When calling JCoRepository.load(java.io.Reader), the cache of the JCoRepository instance was not cleared, neither before reading the metadata nor if an error occurred during the load operation. Thus, previously cached function templates and record metadata as well as newly loaded metadata could have been rendered unusable. Working with such invalid or wrong metadata could have resulted in various follow-up errors like NullPointerExceptions or garbled content data.  This issue hass been fixed.
