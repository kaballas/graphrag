Title: Stateless Pricing - Enable SAP CPQ to Work With Alternative Units of Measure
Description: In pricing results, the condition rates are returned as maintained. Only condition values are returned in the target document currency based on the itemâ€™s target quantity and unit of measure. To help SAP CPQ to cope with condition rates that use alternative units of measure, the item condition details of endpoint POST /api/v1/statelesspricing is enhanced with a new field conditionRateNormalized, which also considers the target currency and the sales unit of measure.   This field is for use in SAP CPQ only and may change becoming incompatible at any time when requested by SAP CPQ. Do not use this field in any other integrations.  See API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
