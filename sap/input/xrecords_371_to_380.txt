Component: SAP Omnichannel Promotion Pricing
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: New Common Superdomain .cloud.sap for SAP Omnichannel Promotion Pricing Services
Description: You are required to switch to the new superdomain .cloud.sap for SAP Omnichannel Promotion Pricing services. The previously known URLs <hostname>.cfapps.<region>.hana.ondemand.com will be deactivated soon. We have postponed the deactivation from June 30, 2025 to October 31, 2025. A prompt switch is strongly encouraged.  Starting October 1, 2025, SAP Omnichannel Promotion Pricing services accessed via the outdated URLs will experience reduced performance. To avoid this, ensure you switch to the new URLs before that date.  For more information, see Calculation, Data Upload, Administration, Data Access, Coupon Management.  It is also recommended to recreate the service keys. This way, you can see the new URL of the service endpoint in the service key. For more information about creating service keys, see Creating Service Keys in the Cloud Foundry Environment.

Title: Meta attribute mapping reordered
Description: The meta attribute mapping is reordered to come before the meta.location attribute mapping in the proxy read transformations of Cloud Foundry UAA Server and SAP BTP XS Advanced UAA (Cloud Foundry). This ensures that the meta.location attribute is set correctly and is not overwritten.  Additionally, the urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:sap:2.0:Group extension schema is added for the group entity in the proxy read transformations of SAP BTP XS Advanced UAA (Cloud Foundry).

Title: Custom OIDC configuration as a list of oidc objects
Description: When provisioning or updating your Kyma runtime, you can now configure the OpenID Connect (OIDC) property as a list of oidc objects. With this setting, you can have multiple OIDC configurations in your cluster. You can also see your complete OIDC configuration in the SAP BTP cockpit.  To ensure you have the necessary attributes for smooth authentication and to prevent access issues, we have added the requiredClaims and groupsPrefix fields to the oidc object.
