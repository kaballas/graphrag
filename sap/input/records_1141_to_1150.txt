Component: SAP Java Buildpack
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: REMINDER: Removal of SAP Java Buildpack 1
Description: We want to remind you that SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and is going to be removed from SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment on June 30, 2025.  Background and Motivation:  SAP Java Buildpack 2 is generally available (GA) since March 2024 and provides support for the latest and greatest versions of Java (17 and 21), Tomcat (10.1), and TomEE (10.0).  SAP Java Buildpack 1, on the other hand, supports older versions of Java (8, 11), Tomcat 9, an SAP-patched version of TomEE 7 (which reached EoL in March 2021), and SapMachine 11 (which also reached EoL in December 2024).  Our goal is to focus our efforts on delivering highly-requested new features, reducing technical debt, and boosting product quality and security.  As a result, SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and will be removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment on June 30, 2025.   Action:    If you have applications running on sap_java_buildpack, you need to migrate them to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta as soon as possible.   To learn how, see: Migrate your Applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2  Timeline:  We plan to support SAP Java Buildpack 1 until June 30, 2025, and then it will be removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.  Applications that haven’t been migrated to SAP Java Buildpack 2 by then might continue to run but will fail if being restaged or redeployed.  In H1 of 2025, new releases of SAP Java Buildpack 1 will be only made for critical security updates and bug fixes.
