Title: MTA deployments will start to fail if service instance update fails
Description: The default behavior of MTA deployment will be changed when there is a failure during service instance update. The change is planned to be done in October 2024.  Currently, the service update is fail-safe, and even in the event of a failure, MTA deployment will proceed successfully. This behavior, however, is problematic as it conceals issues that may arise during MTA deployment, which are only detected at a later stage or even during runtime.  The behavior will be changed and MTA deployments will start to fail in case of service instance update failure.  Action:If a certain service instance should not impact the whole MTA deployment there are two options to proceed. Choose one depending on your needs:    Declare the MTA resource as optional – when making an MTA resource optional all operations related to it are fail-safe. It includes not only the service instance update but also service binding, unbinding, etc. The option is valuable for service instances that are optional during the runtime of your application;      Avoid service instance updates by providing parameter skip-service-updates – the option could be interpreted as “create-only” for the service instance. It is useful when a service instance needs to be created in the initial MTA deployment and not altered afterwards. The parameter skip-service-updates defines the different parts of the service instance that are to be omitted during update. See the example for skipping service updates.

Title: Additional Property Required for Using SAP Task Center
Description: If you are using SAP Task Center together with SAP Build Process Automation in different subaccounts and if your security protocol is SAML 2.0, you must set an additional property in your Identity_Authentication_Connectivity_IDS destination. Add the wfs.tc.sec.prot.rel property and set it to true.  For more information, see SAP Note 3522594 .  If you don’t set this property, the end users might be able to access their SAP Build Process Automation tasks, but some actions might not be available in the Web app of SAP Task Center.  If you have already set the property wfs.tc.local, please remove it from your Identity_Authentication_Connectivity_IDS destination.
