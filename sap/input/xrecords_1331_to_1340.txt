Component: Document Management Service
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Owner Visibility in Key Properties
Description: The Document Management Service, Application Option now displays the owner of the document under the Key Properties tab instead of labeling them as Administrator in the Access Control tab. This update helps you add or update the ownerâ€™s name as an Access Control List (ACL), which then propagates to subfolders and documents.   Previously, the owner appeared as an ACL principal in the application UI, which confused users regarding the difference between the owner and the ACL. By relocating the owner details to the Key Properties tab, we enhance clarity around the object owner and the associated ACLs, thereby improving the overall user experience.
