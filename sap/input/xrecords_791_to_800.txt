Title: The 0 value possible for Auto Scaler Max in additional worker node pools
Description: In additional worker node pools, with high availability disabled, you can scale down Auto Scaler Min to 0 and Auto Scaler Max to 1. This setting helps you reduce costs but is not recommended for production environments. If no user workloads are deployed onto the nodes associated with a given additional worker node pool, the nodes are removed automatically.  For more information, see Additional Worker Node Pools and Assigning Workloads to Worker Node Pools.

Title: Extensions Concept – Disable Buffering of Local Extension Calls
Description: In remote extension implementations, you can return response header Cache-Control: no-store to disable the call buffering of a custom pricing routine. Now it is also possible to disable the call buffering for local extensions by listing the JavaScript function name with the parameter caching: false in a manifest file.

Title: Production - Pricing service – Fix for variant condition field with access type A
Description: When the multivalued attribute KOMP-VARCOND field in an access is marked as hierarchical, the access field (access type = A) and the condition record with an empty variant condition key is maintained. When variant condition keys without maintained condition records were passed as input, the Pricing service used to return different results compared to the back-end pricing. This issue has been corrected.

Title: Production – Currency Conversion – Convert a Currency
Description: There is a new endpoint called POST /currencyConversion/currencies/{fromCurrencyUnit}/convert/{toCurrencyUnit} to receive the exchange rate that is needed to convert a source currency to a target currency. With that, the calling application can convert currencies analogously to how the Pricing service does it during price calculation. The new endpoint also returns an output value converted into the target currency if an input value was given.   See  API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing - Production.
