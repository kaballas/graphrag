Title: New btp CLI server URL
Description: The btp CLI server now has a new, much simpler and shorter URL: https://cli.btp.cloud.sap/  When you log on with the btp CLI, the client prompts you for the CLI server URL or you pass it as parameter. Client versions up until 2.49.0 propose the old server URL (https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/), which will continue to work. If you pass the new URL in an old client, you will be asked to add it as a trusted URL at first usage. Client version 2.54.0 and higher will propose the new URL (https://cli.btp.cloud.sap/), but will still also accept the old one.  For the time being, both URLs work, but we recommend to eventually update your scripts to start using the new server URL.  You can download the btp CLI client version 2.54.0 from SAP Development Tools.  See Log in with the btp CLI.

Title: Edit Template
Description: You can now edit templates. In addition to changing the name and description, you can choose a different schema for the template. Changing the schema makes a new set of extraction fields available for the template.  If youâ€™ve already edited extraction results for sample documents associated with your template, these edits are preserved following the change of schema if the relevant fields appear in both the old and the new schema.  See Edit Template.
