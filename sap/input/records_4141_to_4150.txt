Title: Failing Job in Case of an Invalid package.json File
Description: For a smooth Chromedriver update period, SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery tries to fetch the needed Chromedriver version from the package.json files that are part of the project. If one of these files had an invalid syntax, the connected jobs failed during the Init stage and showed a stack trace instead of a readable error message. Now, these jobs donâ€™t stop in the Init phase anymore and report the invalid package.json file as information only.

Component: Migration Assessment

Title: Extraction Status for Data Extractions
Description: Migration Assessment now displays the extraction status of a data extraction. The extraction status designates if the application encountered any warnings or errors during the extraction that might impact future evaluations of the data. If a data extraction finishes with warnings or errors, some data could not be extracted and might even not be used in the scenario evaluation. In these cases, see the extraction log for details and go back to your SAP Process Orchestration System and fix the issues before starting a new extraction.   Note that extraction status is not available for data extractions made before this software update. If you want to see the extraction status of data that was extracted before the update, you must create a new data extraction with the dataset.  See Concepts and Create a Data Extraction Request.

Component: SAP BTP Command Line Interface
Environment: ABAP,Cloud Foundry,Kyma,Neo,Other
Title: New btp CLI server URL
Description: The btp CLI server now has a new, much simpler and shorter URL: https://cli.btp.cloud.sap/  When you log on with the btp CLI, the client prompts you for the CLI server URL or you pass it as parameter. Client versions up until 2.49.0 propose the old server URL (https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/), which will continue to work. If you pass the new URL in an old client, you will be asked to add it as a trusted URL at first usage. Client version 2.54.0 and higher will propose the new URL (https://cli.btp.cloud.sap/), but will still also accept the old one.  For the time being, both URLs work, but we recommend to eventually update your scripts to start using the new server URL.  You can download the btp CLI client version 2.54.0 from SAP Development Tools.  See Log in with the btp CLI.
