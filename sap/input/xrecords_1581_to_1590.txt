Component: Variant Configuration
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Pre-Production – Configurations API – Read Single Characteristics
Description: There is a new endpoint called GET /api/v2/configurations/{configurationId}/items/{itemId}/characteristics used to read the details of one or more characteristics of an item.   Action: If the UI of the consuming application allows it, it is recommended to always read the configuration results during interactive configuration without the possible values of characteristics. This can be achieved by using the parameter $select omitting the parameter value possibleValue when creating or reading a configuration. Only when the user clicks on a UI element, like a dropdown list box, that requires to render the possible values on the UI, the possible values should be read for that characteristic using the new endpoint. This will improve performance especially when AVC Forwarding is enabled.   See: API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Staged Deployment Strategy
Description: There is a new staged deployment strategy for the Variant Configuration service starting with the 2502 release. New software releases used to be deployed to all customer tenants at the same time. We will continue to do that for our administration UI and our Administration service, but for the configuration and pricing services we will first deploy the 2502 release only to all non-productive tenants (including the partner tenants) on January 22, 2025 and only two weeks later, on February 5, 2025 we will also deploy it to the productive tenants.  Action: It is recommended to make yourself familiar with the release dates on our product page. Review the changes in the Pre-Production version of the documentation that will be published on January 22, and use the given two weeks to test the new release in your non-productive tenants and process the actions of the recommended or required changes that are announced here in the release notes.  See: Release Schedule and Dates.
