Title: Deletion of cipher suites
Description: As a part of security hardening and Kyma security team recommendations, ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA and ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA cipher suites used in default Kyma Gateway have been deprecated since the 2.15 Kyma version. Although we initially planned to remove these cipher suites with Kyma 2.18, we have decided to delay their removal until version 2.19. After the Kyma 2.19 release, clients dependent on the mentioned cipher suites won't be accepted.
