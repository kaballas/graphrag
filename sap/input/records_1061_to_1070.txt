Component: SAP BTP Cockpit
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Analytics Now Available in SAP BTP Cockpit
Description: We have introduced usage analytics to the SAP BTP cockpit. Global account administrators can enable sending anonymized usage data to help us identify and fix issues more quickly. We use analytics data to understand how users interact with the platform and to improve the user experience.  If you chose to opt-in, a global account adminstrator will first need to enable analytics for each global account. Before anyonymized usage data can be sent to SAP, individual global account users will also need to provide their consent. Users can change their consent choices at any time.  To learn about how to enable analytics, see Enable Analytics in the Cockpit.
