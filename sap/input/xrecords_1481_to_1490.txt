Title: Production - Support X.509 Certificates
Description: For getting an oauth token to call an endpoint of the Pricing service it used to be required to specify the client id and the client secret. Instead of the client secret, an X.509 certificate can now be used.  Action: Using X.509 certificates is considered more secure than using client id and client secret. Therefore, it is recommended to use the new approach.   See: Security Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing and Administration Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Production – Configurations API – Read Single Characteristics
Description: There is a new endpoint called GET /api/v2/configurations/{configurationId}/items/{itemId}/characteristics used to read the details of one or more characteristics of an item.   Action: If the UI of the consuming application allows it, it is recommended to always read the configuration results during interactive configuration without the possible values of characteristics. This can be achieved by using the parameter $select omitting the parameter value possibleValue when creating or reading a configuration. Only when the user clicks on a UI element, like a dropdown list box, that requires to render the possible values on the UI, the possible values should be read for that characteristic using the new endpoint. This will improve performance especially when AVC Forwarding is enabled.   See: API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: API Gateway module: Update to version 2.10.3
Description: The API Gateway module in version 2.10.3 includes the following changes:  We’ve changed the hardcoded algorithm from RSA256 to RS256. This change ensures that JWT tokens are processed correctly by the Ory Oathkeeper, resolving the error message signing key 'XXX' declares unsupported algorithm "RSA256".  If you expose a path using a wildcard pattern, now you can also expose the same path without including the trailing slash. For example, if you have a rule that exposes example.com/path/*, you can also expose example.com/path without the slash at the end.

Title: Production - Base Calculations Include Current Percentage Step
Description: In scenarios where a percentage condition spans multiple counters within the same step range in the pricing procedure, the condition base used not to be dynamically adjusted to account for the cumulative effect of prior conditions. Instead, all counters for the condition type used to use the original base amount. This issue has been corrected.
