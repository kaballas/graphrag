Title: Tracking Imports in the Transport Manager
Description: A new screen has been added to the Site Manager – the Transport Manager.   Administrators can use the Transport Manager, accessed from the side panel, to track the progress of an import process. As a result, this process no longer takes control of the Site Manager, allowing administrators to continue working during the import.

Component: Application Autoscaler
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: End of support for the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme (basic auth) when using the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API for security reasons
Description: We are going to make the following change for security reasons. The target audience of the change is developers:   If no credential types are defined in the service binding parameters, the Application Autoscaler service applies a default. This default will be changed to x509 (instead of binding-secret).   Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type", "x509"]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.   For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.  Until 2025-04-30 you may configure the credential-type to binding-secret, to restore the previous configuration.

Component: Pricing Service

Title: Pre-Production -Support X.509 Certificates
Description: For getting an oauth token to call an endpoint of the Pricing service it used to be required to specify the client id and the client secret. Instead of the client secret, an X.509 certificate can now be used.  Action: Using X.509 certificates is considered more secure than using client id and client secret. Therefore, it is recommended to use the new approach.   See: Security Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing and Administration Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Component: Pricing Service

Title: Staged Deployment Strategy
Description: There is a new staged deployment strategy for the Pricing service starting with the 2502 release. New software releases used to be deployed to all customer tenants at the same time. We will continue to do that for our administration UI and our Administration service, but for the configuration and pricing services we will first deploy the 2502 release only to all non-productive tenants (including the partner tenants) on January 22, 2025 and only two weeks later, on February 5, we will also deploy it to the productive tenants.  Action: It is recommended to make yourself familiar with the release dates on our product page. Review the changes in the Pre-Production version of the documentation that will be published on January 22 and use the given two weeks to test the new release in your non-productive tenants and process the actions of the recommended or required changes that are announced here in the release notes.  See: Release Schedule and Dates.
