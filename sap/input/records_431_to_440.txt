Title: Pre-Production – Configurations API – Ability to Set Default Values
Description: There is a new input field author for endpoints PATCH /configurations/{configurationId}/items/{itemId}/characteristics/{characteristicId} and PATCH /configurations/{configurationId}/items/{itemId} that allows not only to set user values for characteristics as before, but also so-called default values that can be changed by users and can be overwritten by rules.   Note  It is not supported for AVC Forwarding and only in exceptional cases it makes sense to set defaults via API.
