Title: Interface com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo has been deprecated
Description: With SAP Java Buildpack 1.77.0, component xs-user-holder is changed due to deprecated code in SAP BTP Security Services Integration Libraries, on which it relies.  Interface com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo was deprecated and later removed with version 3.0.0 of cloud-security-services-integration-library. For more information, see: SAP BTP Security Services Integration Libraries: v 3.0.0  This interface is replaced by a new one – com.sap.xs.security.UserData. It's introduced with version 1.47.0 of xs-user-holder.   If your pom.xml file contains the following <dependency>, that means your project uses xs-user-holder and needs to be adapted:   <dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sjb</groupId>
    <artifactId>xs-user-holder</artifactId>
</dependency>
  The xs-user-holder component currently provides getter and setter methods for working with the deprecated com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo.   Action: If your code uses these methods, make the following modifications:      Replace UserInfoHolder.getUserInfo() with UserInfoHolder.getUserData()      Replace UserInfoHolder.setUserInfo(XSUserInfo userInfo) with UserInfoHolder.setUserData(UserData userData)      Note      The same token information that XSUserInfo provides can be obtained with the new UserData interface.      Getter and setter methods for the deprecated com.sap.xsa.security.container.XSUserInfo will remain available in the xs-user-holder component, and will coexist with the methods from com.sap.xs.security.UserData till December 31, 2023.      When this period is over, everything based on the deprecated code from package com.sap.xsa.security.container will be removed, and only the new UserData interface will be supported in the xs-user-holder component.

Title: Directory Enhancements for Managing Users and Entitlements
Description: Directories are primarily used for grouping your subaccounts, but they can also be used to manage their own entitlements and users. Previously, enabling the entitlement and user management features for a directory was only possible after the directory was created, from the directory's Users and Entitlements pages.   Now, we've made it easier for you to enable these features right from the start when you create a directory, or when editing a directory from the Account Explorer page.  Furthermore, we've added the ability to enable the entitlement management feature for any directory directly on the global account's Entitlements  Entity Entitlements page. Until now, this page did not allow you to select directories that weren't enabled to manage entitlements. Now, these directories can be selected.  For more information, see Entitlements and Quotas, Create a Directory, Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Directories, and Manage Users in Directories.
