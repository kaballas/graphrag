Title: More Accurate Identification of Date Format in Template-Based Extraction
Description: Date formatting during template-based extraction now relies on the date in the associated document to accurately identify the date format.  To enable SAP Document AI to extract dates correctly, and to prevent confusion between month and day, ensure that the date in documents associated with templates is greater than the 12th of the month.

Component: SAP Java Buildpack
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Deprecation of SAP Java Buildpack 1
Description: Please be aware that SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and is going to be removed from SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment in June 2025.  Background and Motivation:  SAP Java Buildpack 2 is generally available (GA) since early March 2024 and provides support for the latest and greatest versions of Java (17 and 21) and Tomcat (10.1). We also plan to support TomEE 10 as soon as it goes GA.  SAP Java Buildpack 1, on the other hand, supports older versions of Java (8, 11), Tomcat 9, and an SAP-patched version of TomEE 7 (which reached EoL in March 2021). SapMachine 11 will also reach EoL soon – in December 2024.  Our goal is to focus our efforts on delivering highly-requested new features, reducing technical debt, and boosting product quality and security.  As a result, SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and technical support for it will be provided until June 30, 2025.   Action:    If you have applications running on sap_java_buildpack, you need to migrate them to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta as soon as possible.   Note  If your applications depend on TomEE 7, don’t start the migration yet but wait until we announce the availability of TomEE 10 in SJB 2.  Migration:      If your applications are compiled with Java 8, they should run successfully on any later version as Java versions are backward compatible. The only exception would be if your apps are using internal or undocumented Java APIs that have been removed or changed. Otherwise, your applications should be running fine and no extra effort from your side is required. Still, we recommend that you thoroughly test your application scenarios with the new Java version (17 or 21).    If your application or its dependencies are using former Java EE javax.* packages, you need to migrate them to Jakarta EE jakarta.* ones. You can do that by using any of the community tools available to run the migration. For example:      https://github.com/apache/tomcat-jakartaee-migration      https://tomee.apache.org/javax-to-jakarta.html          If you have multi-target applications (MTA), you need to adjust all modules with the following types:      java      java.tomcat      java.tomee      Since MTA deployment descriptors currently use sap_java_buildpack as a default buildpack, you need to set the buildpack module parameter to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta. For example:  modules:   - name: myapp       type: java.tomcat       parameters:           buildpack: sap_java_buildpack_jakarta  For more information, see MTA Module Types and Module-Specific Parameters.      Timeline:  We plan to support SAP Java Buildpack 1 until June 30, 2025 when it will be removed from SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. Applications that haven’t been migrated to SAP Java Buildpack 2 by then might continue to run but will get an error when being restaged or redeployed.  In Q4 of 2024, we'll stop adding new features to SAP Java Buildpack 1, and will only provide security updates and bug fixes.   In H1 of 2025, new releases for SAP Java Buildpack 1 will be made only for critical security updates and bug fixes.
