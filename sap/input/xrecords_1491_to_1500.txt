Title: Production – Consider Condition Record Descriptions
Description: For certain back-end releases it is possible to maintain a description on the condition record level that is then displayed in the pricing results instead of the condition type description. This applies only to non-variant conditions. The Pricing service supports the same mechanism. The feature will only be activated on request through a customer ticket on component LOD-CPS-PRC.   See: API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Production – Correct Exchange Rate Type in Currency Conversion Trace
Description: The engine trace used to show an exchange rate type different from the one that was used during price calculation. For example, when the local currency is EUR and the document currency is USD, if the exchange rate type passed is M, but an alternative exchange rate type EURX is maintained in the customizing, the exchange rate is determined based on the alternative type. However, the currency conversion trace did not use to reflect this correctly and displayed the originally passed exchange rate type, M. This discrepancy used to cause confusion during the analysis using the trace information. This issue has been corrected.

Title: Production – Document Pricing - Change the Source of a Pricing Document
Description: When creating a new pricing document with endpoint POST /documents, the owner or source of the document can be specified by providing the following data: The source application, the source type; for example quote, and the source id; for example quote number 49709821. That source information is stored with the pricing document.  The source information can be used as a filter criteria in the APIs to manage stored pricing documents.

Title: Production – Extension Concept - Custom Implementation of Unsupported Standard Routines
Description: Not all standard pricing routines that are available in the back end are also available in the Pricing service. If needed, customers can request the implementation of a missing routine, but SAP might reject this, because the routine is not considered as relevant for the use cases that the Pricing service addresses. In such a case, SAP can allow and enable the customer to use the Pricing service’s extension concept to implement the standard pricing routine on a project-basis. The feature will only be activated on request through a customer ticket on component LOD-CPS-PRC.  See: Supported Standard Pricing Exits and Extension Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
