Title: Changed Behavior When Assigning Codelists to Leaf Nodes
Description: The behavior of the checkbox Use all code values of the codelist during the assignment of codelists to leaf nodes has been changed: If you manually select all code values of a list one by one without selecting the checkbox, the checkbox is no longer checked automatically.   This behavior has consequences, for example, if you migrate your MIG to a new message version and the new version provides more code values: If you didn't select the checkbox, each code value is migrated by itself, and any new code values stay unselected.  See Assigning Codelists to Leaf Nodes.  As Cloud Integration (standalone) customer, see Assigning Codelists to Leaf Nodes.
