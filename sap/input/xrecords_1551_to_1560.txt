Title: Destination Service - New Features
Description:   When calling the Destination service, you can now provide a previously generated and signed SAML assertion when fetching an OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion destination. This SAML assertion will be exchanged for a token with the configured token service, instead of the Destination service generating one based on a provided user token.  A new Destinations UI for managing destination configuration objects is now available as a BETA version in the SAP BTP cockpit, side-by-side with the current UI. It is not yet at feature parity with the current UI, but feel free to try it out and send us your feedback.
