Title: Consistency Check Extended to Check for Deleted Users
Description: The consistency check has now been extended by one further check regarding user assignments. It now also checks whether users assigned to tasks, folders, or on header level have been deleted. If the check detects any deleted users, messages are raised and may cause the consistency check to fail due to errors. The following logic is applied:  If a deleted user is assigned as the user responsible, processing user, or remote processing user, the consistency check fails. No task list generation is possible.  If a deleted user is assigned as an interested user, the consistency check is successful, but it shows warnings. Task list generation is possible.  If a user group consists only of deleted users and is assigned as the responsible user group or processing user group, the consistency check fails. No task list generation is possible.  If a user group consists only of deleted users and is assigned as an interested user group, the consistency check is successful, but it shows warnings. Task list generation is possible.    A consistency check has been run automatically for all templates and the status has been set accordingly.  More information:  How to Perform Checks on Templates  App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: Check whether any of your templates now have the consistency check status Failed. Resolve the errors and run a new consistency check to enable task list generation from these templates.
