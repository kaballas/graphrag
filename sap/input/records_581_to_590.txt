Title: Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes - New Features
Description: Transparent Proxy version 1.8.0 provides the following new features:    The Transparent Proxy now supports the use of customer-signed SAML assertions to obtain OAuth tokens for destinations configured with the OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion authentication flow.For more information, see IAS-Signed SAML Bearer Assertion.  The Transparent Proxy now allows users to specify whether a fragment is optional. If set to true and the fragment does not exist, the Transparent Proxy will manage the connection based solely on the destination.For more information, see Destination Custom Resource and Destination Gateway (Dynamic Lookup of Destinations).  In the Kyma environment, enhanced configuration now allows the Telemetry module to automatically scrape Prometheus metrics from Transparent Proxy.For more information, see Configuration Guide.

Title: Configurable Load-Balancing Algorithm for Application Routes
Description: We’ve added support for configuring the load-balancing algorithm of application routes. The route definition has been extended with a generic options map that allows you to specify which load balancing algorithm you want to use.  Supported Algorithms  Currently, the following load-balancing algorithms are supported:  round-robin: Distributes the load evenly across all available backends.  least-connection: Directs traffic to the backend with the fewest active connections at any given time.  The default algorithm is round-robin.  Configuring the Load-Balancing Algorithm of an Application Route  You have the following options for choosing the load-balancing algorithm of an application route:  Option 1: You can specify the load balancing algorithm in your application manifest using the loadbalancing property of the route options.  Option 2: You can specify the load balancing algorithm in the Cloud Foundry CLI using the commands create-route, update-route, and map-route.  For more information and detailed examples, check out the following resources:  Blog post by SAP: Support for Customizable Load-Balancing Algorithms  Cloud Foundry documentation: Configuring per-route options
