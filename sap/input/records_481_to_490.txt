Title: Introduction of Readiness Health Checks
Description: Starting at the end of September 2025, MTA deployment in Cloud Foundry will support Cloud Foundry readiness health checks by introducing new module-specific parameters:  readiness-health-check-http-endpoint  readiness-health-check-type  readiness-health-check-invocation-timeout  readiness-health-check-interval    Users may encounter problems during MTA deployment if the parameters readiness-health-check-<XYZ> are already defined in their MTA descriptor but are incorrectly configured. In such case, the MTA deployments will start to fail with the error message: None of the instances of the app <app-name> become routable. Please verify that the defined MTA parameters for the readiness health check align with the app's code and configuration.  Action: Review your MTA descriptors and verify the related readiness health check configurations to ensure correctness. To prevent issues when enabling readiness health check support in MTA deployment, follow the guidelines in SAP Note 3625631 .

Title: Switch of the default MTA Java module buildpack to SAP Java Buildpack 2
Description: The default value of the buildpack parameter for modules of type java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee has been changed from sap_java_buildpack (SAP Java Buildpack 1) to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta (SAP Java Buildpack 2). This is done to ensure compliance with the deprecation of SAP Java Buildpack 1.  Action: If you have not yet migrated your applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2, please do so immediately.  If migration is not currently feasible, you can temporarily revert to SAP Java Buildpack 1 by explicitly setting the buildpack or buildpacks parameters for the java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee modules in your MTA deployment descriptor.  This is only a temporary workaround. You are strongly advised to complete the migration to SAP Java Buildpack 2 as soon as possible to ensure continued support and compatibility.  See:  Migrate your Applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2  SAP Java Buildpack 2: Jakarta-Based, Fresh and New!  TomEE 10 has landed in SAP Java Buildpack 2!
