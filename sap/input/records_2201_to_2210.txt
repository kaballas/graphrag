Title: New Instant Learning for Information Extraction Using Generative AI (Premium Edition)
Description: SAP Document AI now allows you to enhance extraction with generative AI by using your edited extraction results to enrich the prompt to large language models (LLMs) with user feedback.  If you use an appropriately configured schema, SAP Document AI learns from your feedback as soon you commit documents with edited extraction results. As a result, information extraction is improved for relevant fields in all subsequent documents.  To use this feature, you must first activate it using the configuration key enableInstantLearning.  See Instant Learning (Premium Edition) and Configuration Keys.

Title: New List of Values Data Type for Schemas (Premium Edition)
Description: With SAP Document AI you can now use the data type list of values to extract header or line item fields with the setup type auto.
