Component: SAP Advanced Financial Closing
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Closing Structure Table Change in Upcoming Release
Description: With the release planned to be made available in February, a second tab will be added to the Closing Structure table. While the Hierarchy tab will display the closing structure as a hierarchy (that is, the way you already know it), the new List tab will show the folders in a list.  This change will affect the personalized views (formerly known as view variants) that you have created for the Closing Structure table. Due to this change, the existing views will be lost with the February release and will need to be recreated afterwards if still required.  Note  Views will be managed separately on both tabs. This means that you will be able to create views specific to one of the tabs without the view appearing in your view management on the other tab.  App affected:  Manage Closing Task Lists  Action: Take note of the views you're currently using. Once the release planned for February is available, go to the Closing Structure table in the Manage Closing Task Lists app and recreate and save the views if they are still required.
