Title: Telemetry module: Update to version 1.17
Description: Version 1.17.0 brings the following improvements:      Telemetry Manager now checks the health of the data flow in agents and gateways, and reports it to the pipeline resources under the new status condition TelemetryFlowHealthy. With this, you can easily detect if there are problems with the data flow for logs, traces, and metrics; for example, caused by unavailability of backends (#425).      For better usability and consistency, we've extended the reasons and messages for status conditions (#1023).      Metrics: Metrics provided using a MetricPipeline input now have a well-defined OTEL instrumentationScope version attribute defined to identify the Telemetry module's version as origin of the metric (#1000).      Metrics, Traces: Update to OTel Collector version 0.100.0 (#1085).      Version 1.17.1 brings the following improvements:      The new version addresses vulnerability CVE-2024-36129 by updating OTel Collector to version 0.102.1 (#1158).    We fixed a bug that prevented accessing the Telemetry module configuration in the Kyma dashboard (#1140).
