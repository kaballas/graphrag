Title: Usability Enhancements Added to SAP BTP Cockpit "Entitlements" Pages
Description: We've made several improvements to the Entitlements  Entity Assignments and Entitlements  Service Assignments in SAP BTP cockpit to enhance usability when managing service assignments in your global account.      Changed layout in Entity Assignments page: The Entity Assignments page now offers two views (tabs):      Manage Assignments: This is where global account admins can distribute the entitled service plans of their global account to subaccounts and directories. The functionality remains the same as before, except for the Configure Entitlements button that has been renamed to Edit.    View Commercial Information: This new tab allows global account admins and viewers to view the commercial source of their entitlements. This feature is not available for trial accounts.        Changed layout in Service Assignments page: The Service Overview option has been moved out of the Service dropdown menu and now has its own All Services view (tab) in the Service Assignments page. As a result, the Service Assignments page now has two views (tabs):      All Services: Provides an overview of all available service entitlements of your global account.      Assignments by Service: Allows you to choose specific services and see how their service plans are assigned to subaccounts and directories within your global account.          Improved visibility of free service plans: When configuring assignments in the Entity Assignments page, the Add Service Plans dialog box now displays the "Always Free" and "Free Tier" labels for service plans falling into these categories. This enhancement allows you to easily identify which plans are not charged for consumption.      Enhanced Service Assignments page: In the Service Assignments page, under the All Services view, we have added a new column called Assigned To. It shows you the total number of directories and subaccounts to which each service plan is assigned in your global account. You can click on the links in this column to quickly navigate to the selected service view and display more details about these assignments.      Access to service-related links: Documentation links, support info links, and SAP Discovery Center links, have been added when available. These links can be accessed in the Add Service Plans dialog box in the Entity Assignments page and in the main table of both Entitlements pages by clicking on the new    (Service Details) icon for any service listed under the Service Technical Name column.      Improved search functionality: In both Entitlements pages, the Search field has been relocated to the top of the page. You can now search for more than one term. Also, when you start typing, you get a list of suggestions. This change makes it more convenient for you to quickly search for specific entitlements or services.      New Plan Display Name column: We've added a new Plan Display Name column to both Entitlements pages. By default, this column is hidden, but you can choose to display it if needed.      See Managing Entitlements and Quotas Using the Cockpit, Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Directories, and Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Subaccounts.
