Title: Deprecation of SAML for User-Interactive Authentication in Customer-Owned Accounts
Description: This announcement is only for subaccount administrators managing business users in SAP BTP subaccounts.  SAML trust configurations are deprecated for user-interactive authentication in customer-owned accounts regardless of the specific identity provider. The CIO Guide: Identity Lifecycle in SAP Landscapes provides the guidance for this deprecation. We recommend a single trust configuration per subaccount with SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. This configuration enables direct usage of SAP Cloud Identity Services by applications and services, meaning without the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service. Such direct usage of SAP Cloud Identity Services is the recommended programming model for new applications and services.  The deprecation doesn't apply to the following cases:      Principal propagation using the SAML Bearer flow. An example for this is an SAML trust configuration to accept API calls on behalf of users from another subaccount using a destination.      Trust between a partner-owned subaccount and a customer-owned tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services. OIDC support for this constellation is planned, but isn't possible yet. Until then, use SAML and make sure the trusted identity provider is already SAP Cloud Identity Services and not any other identity provider.      Trust between your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant and your corporate identity provider.      Note  This announcement has no bearing on the use of SAML for other SAP products or other use cases within the SAP BTP family of solutions.   Existing SAML trust configurations affected by the deprecation will still be tolerated after the deprecation date and continue to work. Support will be restricted to security-related fixes.   Impact  When you create a new trust configuration for interactive login, choose a tenant of SAP Cloud Identity Services with the OIDC protocol. Use Establish Trust in the SAP BTP cockpit or the btp create security/trust command of the btp CLI. For more information, see the documentation about Establish Trust. If you have a corporate identity provider, use SAP Cloud Identity Services as a proxy and then connect corporate identity providers with SAML or OIDC.  We recommend migrating existing SAML trusts according to the documentation Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect Trust with SAP Cloud Identity Services, however this isn't mandatory until the deprecation date. The following cases are covered:        Trust to SAP Cloud Identity Services: A simple change of protocol.      Trust to another identity provider: SAP Cloud Identity Services is inserted as a proxy between the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service and your corporate identity provider.   Note  The restriction of a single Identity Authentication OIDC trust per subaccount also applies here.
