Title: View and Configure Default Resources Requirements for Graphs in the Modeler
Description: You can now view the default resource limits for a graph in the Resources section of the Configuration panel in the Modeler. Hover your mouse over the Information icon next to the Resources heading. You can change the limits in the Configuration panel for the current graph.

Title: New Metric Type cpuutil
Description: A new metric type called cpuutil (CPU utilization) is now available. This metric type is linked to the CPU entitlement usage of an application in Cloud Foundry, which depends on its size (memory). cpuutil allows users to set scaling rules based on CPU entitlement, such as scaling up if the usage exceeds 80% and scaling down if it falls below 40%.  Recommendation: If you use the cpu metric, we recommend you to switch to cpuutil to specify thresholds with values from 0% to 100%, which eliminates the need to calculate the CPU entitlement for your application.
