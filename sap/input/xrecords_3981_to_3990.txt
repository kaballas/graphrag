Title: Deprecation of the serverless-registry-config Secret handling
Description: We have now moved the possibility of defining the custom Docker registry using the auto-detected serverless-registry-config Secret to a dedicated configuration option in Serverless CR.  Serverless will still recognize the serverless-registry-config custom Secrets created before, so they will work until the end of the depreciation period (April 1st, 2024).

Title: Release of the Application Connector module
Description: As we continue on our path to modularization, we’d like to inform you that Application Connector is now a module!  This module lets you easily and securely manage the connection between external systems and Kyma.  All the existing clusters have the module enabled by default. In the new clusters, you will have to enable it manually. To do that, check the Enable and Disable a Kyma Module tutorial.  New versions of the Application Connector module, with new features, bug fixes, or security patches, will be distributed to your Kyma runtimes using the release channels.  For more information on the Application Connector module, check the Application Connector module documentation.  We invite you to leave feedback in the Application Connector Manager GitHub Repository.
