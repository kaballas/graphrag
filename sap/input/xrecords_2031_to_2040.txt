Title: API Gateway module: Update to verison 2.7.0
Description: This release contains the following changes:     We've added support for short host name in version v2alpha1 of APIRule. If you only provide the leftmost label in the spec.hosts field of an APIRule custom resource (CR), it uses the domain name from the referenced Gateway, expanding the host to <label>.<gateway domain>. See Sample Custom Resources.      We've fixed the wildcard path format and the validation of the rule path in an APIRule.      Release 2.7 of the API Gateway module includes the fully functional version of APIRule v2alpha1 with noAuth, jwt, and extAuth access strategies. Version v2alpha1 is not meant for use in a production environment but for testing purposes only. After the rollout to the regular channel on October 28, 2024, you’ll be required to start testing the migration procedure. To learn more, see the APIRule migration blog post. It provides the timeline for deletion of APIRule v1beta1 and covers the following migration scenarios:  From the noop, allow, or no_authhandler in version v1beta1 to the noAuth handler in version v2alpha1  From the jwt handler in version v1beta1 to the new configuration of the jwt handler in version v2alpha1    The migration procedure from OAuth2 handlers based on Ory Oathkeeper to the new extAuth handler will be published in the next blog post. For now, see the tutorial Exposing a Workload with extAuth.
