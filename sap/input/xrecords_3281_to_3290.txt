Title: General User Interface and Behavior Changes
Description: Some user interface and behavior changes have now been released. Aside from smaller improvements, the following two changes have been implemented:  Filter and sorting settings in tables have been enhanced:When you click on one of the columns, you now see a pop-over screen allowing you to easily define whether to sort a column in ascending or descending order, and to group the table by the column you've selected. Additionally, you can quickly access further sorting, filter, grouping, and column settings directly from this pop-over.î‡•  A change has been made to when field values you enter are validated:Field validation now takes place only once you either hit Enter or choose Save. This allows you to finalize your entries and only then get them validated and receive corresponding messages.    Apps affected: All apps
