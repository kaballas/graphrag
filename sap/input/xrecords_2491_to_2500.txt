Description: Administrators can now map cards to destinations.  After creating a new content channel that contains cards, the administrator must map any destinations defined in the cards to runtime destinations defined in the SAP BTP cockpit.   To do this, use the Map Aliases option, located in the Status column of the channel in the Channel Manager, and map the destinations in the Cards Aliases tab (new).  Note that the mapping is required for new content channels. Existing channels will continue to work with no further actions.
