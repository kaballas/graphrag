Title: Deprecation of Weak Client Certificate Chains
Description: As originally announced on May 18, 2023 and November 2, 2023, weak client certificate chains have been deprecated for the region br10 in order to harden security standards.   Accordingly, the OpenSSL security has been raised to level 2, resulting in weak certificates or certificate chains no longer being accepted by the platform. For more information and a full definition of security level 2, see https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR.   Note that this change only affects client certificates. If you do not use client certificates or mTLS to authenticate with the platform, you are not affected.   For more details on the command, see 3333978 .
