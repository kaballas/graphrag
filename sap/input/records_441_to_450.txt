Description: This initial orchestration endpoint is deprecated and is scheduled for decommissioning on October 31, 2026. Following that date, the endpoint will no longer be available. We recommend that you create new orchestration workflows using version 2, and that you migrate existing workflows from version 1 to version 2. To use version 2, you'll need to update your endpoint from /completion to /v2/completion and modify your existing payloads. For more information, see SAP Note Orchestration Workflow V2 and  3634540 .
