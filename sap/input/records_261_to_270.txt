Title: Application Interface Framework Enablement
Description: You can build and manage your own application interfaces in ABAP development tools for Eclipse (ADT) with the SAP Application Interface Framework (AIF). Due to the lack of ADT for AIF, the development objects for asynchronous integrations (event consumption model and asynchronous SOAP services) currently generate their corresponding AIF interfaces with default monitoring settings automatically. With new AIF development capabilities in ADT, these AIF interfaces can be customized. Custom AIF interfaces can also be created, for monitoring the background processing framework (bgPF) in ABAP Cloud, for example.

Title: Background Processing Framework - Final Version
Description: Background processing is very important for business applications. A lot of logic can be executed asynchronously to improve performance. In scenarios where changes of the current LUW are to be communicated remotely, the asynchronous execution is even mandatory to be compliant with the SAP LUW (due to implicit database commits).  We want to simplify and improve the background processing by covering all required qualities like: “exactly once”, “in order”, testability and an integration into the ADT cross trace for better supportability.  In the next step of bgPF the AIF integration and its monitoring capabilities are provided. In addition, "in order" capabilities are supported.  For more information, see Background Processing Framework.

Title: CDS Hierarchy Generation Wizard
Description: Defining hierarchies for the use in a CDS view can become a complex task, with the need not only for the CDS hierarchy definition itself, but also for a directory, nodes, text views, and more. With the new hierarchy generation wizard, their creation becomes easier, quicker and less error-prone. The wizard will derive potential hierarchy nodes already from the start (on the master data view) and guide you through the creation process.
