Title: Document Pricing – Manage the Source of a Document
Description: When creating a new pricing document with endpoint POST /pricing/documents, the owner or source of the document can be specified: The source application, the source type; for example, quote, and the source id; for example, the quote number 49709821, can be passed and are stored with the pricing document.   The source information can be used as filter criteria in the new API to manage stored documents.   Action: It is recommended to specify the source of a pricing document, so that it can later be used to identify the owner of the document and to judge if it can be deleted again.   See  API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Istio module: Update to verison 1.9.0
Description: During the Istio upgrade, Pods with the Istio sidecar proxies are now divided into smaller groups and restarted in multiple reconciliations instead of all at once. This increases the stability and reliability of the reconciliation for the Istio module's operator. See issue #155.  We've updated the Istio version to 1.23.2. Read the Istio 1.23.2 release announcement and Istio 1.23.0 Change Notes. Take note of the following breaking changes included in the new minor version of Istio:  Deferred cluster creation: In the context of Envoy, a cluster is a group of logically similar upstream hosts that Envoy connects to. Typically, clusters are defined and created at startup. This means that regardless of whether or not a cluster will be used during the lifetime of the Envoy process, it will still be initialized. Envoy has introduced a new optimization that allows these clusters to be created on the worker threads inline during requests, which can save memory and CPU cycles. If you rely on the old behavior, consider using the compatibility mode, which disables the deferred cluster creation feature by setting ENABLE_DEFERRED_CLUSTER_CREATION to false.  Updates to Envoy cluster metrics parsing: Previously, the Envoy cluster metrics for services that did not use the .svc.cluster.local suffix were incorrectly truncated and parsed. This was because Envoy cluster metrics use dots . as a delimiter between metric namespaces. It is impossible to properly distinguish between those delimiters and the dots in hostnames or cluster names. To address this, the regex for parsing cluster_name has been updated to look for a semicolon that indicates the end of a cluster's name. If you have any dependency on the full stat name for cluster metrics, you must update your monitoring system to account for this change. If you require more time to make adjustments, consider using the compatibility mode, which reverts this behavior by setting ENABLE_DELIMITED_STATS_TAG_REGEX to false.

Title: Telemetry module: Update to version 1.25.0
Description: The new version brings the following improvements:      Logs, Metrics, and Traces: You can list all resources across the pipeline types LogPipeline/TracePipeline/MetricPipeline using kubectl get kyma-telemetry-pipelines (#1487).      Metrics: You can now monitor the health of the Telemetry module: By default, every MetricPipeline reports status metrics about the active pipeline and its conditions, which you can use for alerting and troubleshooting (#1294).  For details, see Setting up a MetricPipeline: Monitor Pipeline Health.      Metrics: Now, you can collect metrics (memory, CPU, and filesystem usage) about the Kubernetes Nodes of your cluster: In the runtime input of MetricPipeline, enable the new selector for Node metrics (#1300).  For details, see Setting up a MetricPipeline: Activate Runtime Metrics.    Traces and Metrics: Improved validation for HTTP-based OTLP endpoints using path and port (#1492).    Traces and Metrics: Update to OTel Collector 0.111.0 (#1497).

Title: Document Pricing – Manage Stored Documents
Description: The new endpoint GET /pricing/documents serves to get a list of stored pricing documents. The API offers different filter capabilities, for example, filtering based on the source of the document.  The source of the pricing document can be specified when creating a new document through the endpoint POST /pricing/documents as described above.   A stored pricing document can be read with the endpoint GET /pricing/documents/{documentId}.   A stored document can be deleted using the endpoint DELETE /pricing/documents/{documentId}.
