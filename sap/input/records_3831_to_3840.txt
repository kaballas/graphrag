Title: Automatic Detection of Chromium Version
Description: SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery now automatically detects which chromedriver version to use. Therefore, the version set in the package.json file associated with your job is not necessarily taken into account, but rather the Chromium version that is available in the environment. We recommend to use latest for chromdedriver version in the package.json file.  To use this feature in your local development, add the property detect_chromedriver_version=true in a .npmrc file.
