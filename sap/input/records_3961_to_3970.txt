Title: Refresh Token Flow of OIDC Protocol Restricted to Validity of Web Session
Description: As announced 2023-08-16, with this change, the service couples the validity of refresh tokens to the session timeout. Refresh tokens expire with the user session, unless you add the offline_access scope.  Action: Check if you define a refresh token validity for your applications longer than 12 h:      Yes: Ensure that you decouple the refresh token from the user session with the offline_access scope.  For more information, see Token Policy Configuration for Applications.      No: Nothing to do.

Title: TLS 1.2 Cipher-Block-Chaining Ciphers Deleted
Description: As announced on October 19, 2023, the following TLS 1.2 Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) Ciphers have been removed from the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment for the region eu20:        TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384      Note that TLS 1.3 Cipher Suites are not affected by this change.  Action:  Older clients might be affected by this change. To maintain connectivity, please check and ensure that your clients are supporting one of the following TLS 1.2 ciphers that are still supported:     TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      After the deletion of the deprecated ciphers, requests from older HTTP client libraries that do not include any of the supported ciphers will fail during the TLS handshake. To verify that your client can connect without CBC ciphers, you can connect it to the following test application. If the client can establish a connection to the endpoint, the server returns the message ok along with a status code 200.  Endpoint with CBC disabled: https://tls12-no-cbc.ciphers.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com

Title: Cloud Connector 2.16.1 - Bug Fixes
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.16.1 provides the following bug fixes:    LDAP role names were wrongly displayed in the administration UI. Actually, the position was shifted by one. Note  The runtime was not affected.This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  Passwords with leading or trailing spaces did not work neither in the logon screen nor in the LDAP test UI. When creating a backup in the administration UI with a password containing special characters, it could not be restored. This was a regression introduced with version 2.15.1.The issue has been fixed.Note  Creating backups with the REST API was not affected.    Selecting a subaccount in the administration UI might have failed. This happened if there are more than 100 subaccounts hosted on the Cloud Connector instance and when filtering the subaccount list. In this case, a completely different one was selected when choosing the subaccount. This was a regression in version 2.16.0.The issue has been fixed.  During an upgrade via RPM it could happen that the UI after the initial login screen was not loading. In the traces of the Cloud Connector, you could see many messages telling that a JAR file could not be found that was existing only before the upgrade. This could be resolved by a restart of the daemon only. The issue was caused by another issue in upgrade processing, which has been improved to avoid the erroneous situation.  Avoid a NullPointerException when receiving a close request in RFC protocol processing. This could lead to wrong values for the connection monitor for RFC connections. The call stack of the exception started with java.lang.NullPointerException: while trying to invoke the method com.sap.core.connectivity.spi.processing.TargetHost.connectionProtocol() of a null object loaded from local variable 'target' at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.updateNonRequestBased(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:109) at com.sap.scc.metering.backend.BackendCallStatisticsCollector.reportCloseConnection(BackendCallStatisticsCollector.java:96)  Corrupted subaccounts could not be loaded properly. As a consequence, it was impossible to delete them from the administration UI. In some cases, they even did not appear in the list of subaccounts, but were existing, so trying to add such a subaccount would fail.This issue has been fixed.      Self-signed system certificates containing SANs need to have all CA attributes, which is not desired for the system certificate, and hence it does not have them. As a consequence, such a certificate cannot be added to the trust store of a server, which is needed to establish trust. By not allowing to add SAN elements to self-signed system certificates, this problem can no longer occur.      A denial of service vulnerability in the Cloud Connector was fixed.For more information, see security note https://me.sap.com/notes/3362463.
