Title: Upcoming upgrade to Kubernetes 1.32
Description: The Kyma environment is planned to be upgraded to the Kubernetes 1.32 release in the June 13-15th general maintenance windows.  This is the schedule per cloud provider region:    Asia Pacific & Japan (APJ) regions: 2025-06-14 14:00 - 17:00 UTC  Europe regions: 2025-06-14 21:00 - 24:00 UTC  Americas regions: 2025-06-15 06:00 - 09:00 UTC  Middle East regions: 2025-06-13 17:00 - 21:00 UTC    For more information on the upcoming release, see the feature highlights, deprecations, and removals in the blog post and the Kubernetes release notes.  Note: There are no urgent upgrade notes for the 1.32 release.  Action: There is one API removal in Kubernetes v1.32. The flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3 API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration has been removed. To prepare for this, you must edit your existing manifests and rewrite client software to use the flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1 API version, available since v1.29. All existing persisted objects are accessible via the new API. Notable changes in flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3 include that the PriorityLevelConfiguration spec.limited.nominalConcurrencyShares field only defaults to 30 when unspecified, and an explicit value of 0 is not changed to 30.

Title: REMINDER: Removal of SAP Java Buildpack 1
Description: SAP Java Buildpack 1 has been deprecated and will be removed from SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment on June 30, 2025. As a consequence, deployments of MTAs containing modules of type java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee might start to fail, as the buildpack used by default is SAP Java Buildpack 1.   To ensure compliance with this change, starting from the beginning of July, the MTA deployment will switch the default value for the buildpack parameter from sap_java_buildpack (SAP Java Buildpack 1) to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta (SAP Java Buildpack 2).  Action:  Plan and migrate your applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2 ahead of the scheduled change. In your deployment descriptors, you need to explicitly set one of the parameters buildpack or buildpacks of the java, java.tomcat, and java.tomee modules to sap_java_buildpack_jakarta. Note that this transition involves more than just configuration updates and may require code modifications.  See:  Migrate your Applications to SAP Java Buildpack 2  SAP Java Buildpack 2: Jakarta-Based, Fresh and New!  TomEE 10 has landed in SAP Java Buildpack 2!

Component: Cloud Logging
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Upcoming OpenSearch Stack Update
Description: Heads-Up: Cloud Logging will upgrade its underlying OpenSearch stack from OpenSearch 1.3 to OpenSearch 2.19. The upgrade will be done in a phased approach allowing for an extensive preview/exploration phase before the eventual forced upgrade.  Action Required: For most instances, there should be no changes. However, you might be affected if you are using anything of the following:      mapping types in your custom indices  Destination API to manage destinations  Wildcard queries against text fields with the option case_insensitive:false      For detailed guidance on how to address these cases and the timelines for the phased rollout, see SAP Note 3617458 .  In case you build dashboards on your own: we noticed a few minor UI glitches (such as text wrapping, sizing, alignment difference). We will publish guidance on how to adapt the dashboards in early Q3, 2025.
