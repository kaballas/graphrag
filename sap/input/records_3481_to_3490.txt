Component: Connectivity
Environment: Cloud Foundry,Kyma
Title: Connectivity Proxy for Kubernetes - Announcement
Description: The Connectivity Proxy in the Kyma runtime will be converted to a standard Kyma third party module.   All existing instances of the Connectivity Proxy must be converted to the new module-based solution. The migration is automated and happens upon enabling the Connectivity Proxy module. After the migration, the Connectivity Proxy will be consumable in the same way as before.   The migration has two stages.   As of March 2, 2024, the module will be available via the 'fast' channel. All customers can then enable it and make the switch (it will also be available for new installations).   Then, on March 16, 2024, during a maintenance window, all remaining connectivity proxies provisioned via the old approach will automatically be migrated to the module by SAP.   While the migration results in a backward-compatible deployment of the Connectivity Proxy, the process involves a downtime of around 2 minutes (depending on cluster load and other factors).   In case of questions or issues, please raise a support ticket on the BC-CP-CON-K8S-PROXY component.
