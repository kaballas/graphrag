Title: Introduced a new deployment strategy "Incremental Blue-Green Deployment"
Description: The new incremental blue-green deployment strategy represents a combination of the following strategies:    blue-green deployment, where new applications are created, and after each execution of the deployment, new bindings and credentials are generated for the applications.      rolling deployment, where the total number of application instances is constant, so the consumed memory and quota stay flat.      See (Experimental) Incremental Blue-Green Deployment Strategy and this example.  [Experimental]

Component: Authorization and Trust Management Service

Title: Change of Default Credential Type to binding-secret
Description: We are going to make the following change for security reasons. The target audience of the change are developers.  If no credential types are defined in the application security descriptor, the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service applies a default. This default will be changed to binding-secret (instead of instance-secret).   Action  Check whether you are affected by the change. The change only affects new service instances (including reuse services) if all of the following prerequisites are true:      Allowed credential types are not configured in the security descriptor.      No parameters are passed during the creation of a binding or service key.      If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the binding-secret credential type before this change is activated. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the following credential types in the application security descriptor:    [binding-secret", "x509"]    It has the same effect as the planned change.    Recommendation  We strongly recommend to configure binding-secret and x509 as allowed credential types (or x509 alone) in conjunction with a regular credential rotation (see Service Instance Secrets).    For more information, see Application Security Descriptor Configuration Syntax.
