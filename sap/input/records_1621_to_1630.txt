Component: Application Autoscaler
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: End of support for the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme (basic auth) when using the Application Autoscaler Custom Metrics API for security reasons
Description: We are going to make the following change for security reasons. The target audience of the change is developers:   If no credential types are defined in the service binding parameters, the Application Autoscaler service applies a default. This default will be changed to x509 (instead of binding-secret).   Action    Check whether you will be affected by the upcoming changes. The upcoming changes only affect new service bindings if any of the following prerequisites are true:       No credential-type parameter is passed during the creation of the binding.       If you are affected, ensure that your application works with secrets of the x509 credential type before we activate this change. You can easily test the new behavior by specifying the x509 credential type in the binding parameter:   [“credential-type", "x509"]   It has the same effect as the planned changes.   Recommendation    We strongly recommend configuring x509 as credential type.   For more information on how to use the x509 credential type, see Defining a Custom Metric.  Until 2025-04-30 you may configure the credential-type to binding-secret, to restore the previous configuration.

Component: Pricing Service

Title: Pre-Production -Support X.509 Certificates
Description: For getting an oauth token to call an endpoint of the Pricing service it used to be required to specify the client id and the client secret. Instead of the client secret, an X.509 certificate can now be used.  Action: Using X.509 certificates is considered more secure than using client id and client secret. Therefore, it is recommended to use the new approach.   See: Security Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing and Administration Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Staged Deployment Strategy
Description: There is a new staged deployment strategy for the Pricing service starting with the 2502 release. New software releases used to be deployed to all customer tenants at the same time. We will continue to do that for our administration UI and our Administration service, but for the configuration and pricing services we will first deploy the 2502 release only to all non-productive tenants (including the partner tenants) on January 22, 2025 and only two weeks later, on February 5, we will also deploy it to the productive tenants.  Action: It is recommended to make yourself familiar with the release dates on our product page. Review the changes in the Pre-Production version of the documentation that will be published on January 22 and use the given two weeks to test the new release in your non-productive tenants and process the actions of the recommended or required changes that are announced here in the release notes.  See: Release Schedule and Dates.

Title: Pre-Production – Configurations API – Read Single Characteristics
Description: There is a new endpoint called GET /api/v2/configurations/{configurationId}/items/{itemId}/characteristics used to read the details of one or more characteristics of an item.   Action: If the UI of the consuming application allows it, it is recommended to always read the configuration results during interactive configuration without the possible values of characteristics. This can be achieved by using the parameter $select omitting the parameter value possibleValue when creating or reading a configuration. Only when the user clicks on a UI element, like a dropdown list box, that requires to render the possible values on the UI, the possible values should be read for that characteristic using the new endpoint. This will improve performance especially when AVC Forwarding is enabled.   See: API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
