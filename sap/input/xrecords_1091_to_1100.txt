Title: New Access Type Option for the JMS Adapter
Description: You can now configure your queues to either exclusive or non-exclusive access types. With the non-exclusive access type, messages are processed concurrently by multiple worker nodes, offering higher throughput. While with exclusive acces type messages are processed messages are processed sequentially by a single consumer, maintaining the order in which messages are received, which is essential for scenarios requiring strict sequencing. For more information on these configuration options, see: Configure the JMS Sender Adapter, and Configure the JMS Receiver Adapter.
