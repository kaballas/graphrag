Title: Istio module: Update to version 1.19.3
Description: Version 1.19.3 introduces the following improvements:    We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled.  We've fixed a bug where the app.kubernetes.io/version label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources.    Version 1.19.2 introduces the following improvements:    We've updated the Istio version to 1.26.2. For more information, read the Istio 1.26.2 release announcement and Istio 1.26.0 release announcement.  We've fixed a bug where the proxy-protocol EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the Warning state. See issue #1491.    Version 1.19.1 introduces the following improvement:    We've fixed an issue where defining multiple external authorizers in the Istio CR resulted in only the last one being configured in the Istio installation configuration.    Version 1.19.0 introduces the following improvements:      We've updated Istio to version 1.26.1 (#1463). Read the Istio 1.26.1 release announcement and Istio 1.26.0 release announcement.      EnvoyFilters not created by the API Gateway module's RateLimit are now detected. When the module detects such an EnvoyFilter, it sets the Istio custom resource (CR) to the Warning state.
