Component: UI Theme Designer
Environment: Cloud Foundry
Title: Belize is deprecated for theming
Description: It is time to migrate your custom theme based on Belize to a theme based on Horizon or Quartz. Some UI frameworks do not support Belize themes in their latest versions anymore. For example, SAPUI5 doesn't support Belize themes from 1.120 upwards, see Supported Combinations of Themes and Libraries for details. Themes based on a Belize theme will not run anymore for all UI frameworks. This is why using Belize themes as base for a custom theme is deprecated. If you have created a custom theme based on a Belize theme, please migrate your theme to a Horizon or Quartz theme. You find a how-to at Migrating Themes. Belize is removed for theming at the beginning of 2025.
