Title: Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes - Enhancements
Description: Transparent Proxy version 1.6.0 provides the following enhancements:      The Transparent Proxy now responds to Connectivity Proxy updates, providing enhanced synchronization between components.      Improved user experience in the Kyma environment by setting the initially created Destination service instance as the default. This eliminates the need for manual configuration and reduces the complexity of setting up the Transparent Proxy.   For more information, see Destination Service Integration.      Improved user experience in the Kyma environment by creating a "gateway" destination custom resource by default, allowing you to start using destinations immediately without additional configuration in the Kyma instance.   For more information, see Destination Gateway.      Added extensions to the Kyma dashboard for configuration management. You can now create, update, and delete destination custom resources or update the Transparent Proxy configuration using the new user interface views.      Destinations can now be consumed directly from the destination custom resource namespace without specifying the Transparent Proxy namespace in the URL.   For more information, see Using the Transparent Proxy.
