Title: Improvement of the overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters by proper index sizing.
Description: The overall stability of Cloud Logging's OpenSearch clusters will be improved by proper index sizing, especially in high-ingest and huge storage volume scenarios. To achieve this we will switch from daily indexes to the index rollover approach targeting the 2501a release (RTC 06.02.25)   With this change, the index names will have a new format. They won't contain the date suffix anymore (e.g., logs-json-2024.11.19), but a six-digit number (e.g. logs-json-000032). Such an index can contain logs from multiple days. Also, there might be several indexes containing data from the same day.  This should not affect most use cases, but if there is strict a dependency on the date suffix in the index name format, this needs to be adapted.  This will further sharpen the retention policy, meaning that the deletion targets indexes created before the last n X 24 hours (where n is the retention configuration) instead of deleting the indexes based on day boundaries (UTC). This also fixes untimely deletion of indexes for customer located further away from UTC.
