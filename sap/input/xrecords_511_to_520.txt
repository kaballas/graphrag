Title: Introduction of New API Modeling Checkbox
Description: A new checkbox, API Modelling, has been introduced in the activation process for API Management. Previously, after selecting the Manage APIs checkbox, it was noted that the API portal was enabled by default on the next screen. Now, instead of this note, the API Modelling checkbox will be displayed, which will also be enabled by default.  This change provides a more intuitive way to activate the API Management capabilities during setup. For more information, see Activating and Configuring API Management Capability.
