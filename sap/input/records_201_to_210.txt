Title: Configurations API - Avoid Retry When Using Inactive Knowledge Bases
Description: An internal retry logic used to be applied to requests which failed because the corresponding knowledge base was inactive, which led to long response times. This issue has been corrected.  A knowledge base can become inactive if a customer triggers a reload from the administration UI by specifying a valid-from date later than the valid-from date of the used knowledge base.  See Administration Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Behavior Changes of Task Instances REST APIs
Description: According to the latest update, APIs for patching and retrieving task contexts are corrected. As a result, task context is now independent of workflow contexts right after input evaluation. The system now ensures this independence, whereas previously it relied solely on modelling best practices.The system processes follow-up actions after completing a task asynchronously. In rare cases, errors from Forms and Approval Forms may now appear on the Logs section of the Instance Details view instead of coming through the API responses. Only users with the Administrator role can see the logs.
