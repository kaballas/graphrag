Title: ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse: Working with the Log When Migrating CDS DDIC-Based Views to CDS View Entities
Description: After finishing the simulation or migration of CDS DDIC-based views to CDS view entities, you can now filter the log on the result page using the Show Objects drop-down list box. These options enhance readability by limiting the number of displayed results.  In addition, you can now rerun a simulation or migration. This helps you to restart the process for a set of CDS DDIC-based views at the beginning. For example, you can trigger the productive migration from the result page of a simulation.  See Migrating CDS DDIC-Based Views to CDS View Entities.

Title: Custom Code Analysis: 3-Tier Model ATC Checks
Description: There are now two new ATC checks of category 3-Tier Model: "Usage of APIs" and "Allowed Enhancement Technologies".  "Usage of APIs" verifies the usage of classic Tier 2 and Tier 3 ABAP development objects based on the usage guidelines of SAP APIs. It analyzes all ABAP development objects, except for those with ABAP language version "Key User" or "ABAP Cloud Development", by identifying their used APIs. For APIs that should not be used, the ATC check shares information on successors, if any.  "Allowed Enhancement Technologies" identifies whether only the BAdI enhancement technology has been used in the code.  Please update your allowed RFC function modules in your cloud connector accordingly. To do this, apply 2861842 .
