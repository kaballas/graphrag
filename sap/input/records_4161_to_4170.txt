Title: Renew Certificates
Description: Following the announcement of the root certificate replacement in SAP Business Technology Platform, we will be renewing our certificates in the upcoming weeks to be signed by DigiCert Global Root G2. This may have an impact on technical clients calling our REST APIs that do not trust DigiCert Global Root G2.  Action:   Check your trust stores  In systems where you manage the trusted certificates yourself, check if the G1 certificate exists. If it does, and its use is related to SAP BTP products, add the new G2 certificate. Don't remove the G1 certificate yet as both are needed for the transition period.  For more information, see SAP Note 3327214  and the Changing the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment Root Certificate Authority blog post.

Title: Deletion of TLS 1.2 Cipher-Block-Chaining Ciphers Postponed
Description: The deletion of TLS 1.2 Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) Ciphers for the region eu20, which had received an updated timeline on October 5, 2023 and was scheduled to take place on October 19, 2023 has been postponed. It is now planned for November 16, 2023.   The following ciphers are affected:        TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384      Note that TLS 1.3 Cipher Suites are not affected by this change.  Action:  Older clients might be affected by this change. To maintain connectivity, please check and ensure that your clients are supporting one of the following TLS 1.2 ciphers that are still supported:     TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384      After the deletion of the deprecated ciphers, requests from older HTTP client libraries that do not include any of the supported ciphers will fail during the TLS handshake. To verify that your client can connect without CBC ciphers, you can connect it to the following test application. If the client can establish a connection to the endpoint, the server returns the message ok along with a status code 200.  Endpoint with CBC disabled: https://tls12-no-cbc.ciphers.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com
