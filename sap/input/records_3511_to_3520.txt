Title: Istio module: Update to version 1.3.1
Description: With this release, we've introduced conditions to the Istio custom resource status. Read Istio Controller Overview for more details.  To ensure consistency between the Istio trace settings, the Telemetry module's trace feature, and OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions, we have improved the service.name value, which is attached to every span emitted by the Istio proxy. To determine the service name, the Istio module now follows the same conventions as the Telemetry module. First, it tries to leverage the kubernetes.io/name label. If not available, it checks for the app label. If neither label is present, it falls back to using the Deployment's name. Additionally, the namespace suffix is not attached anymore to the service name, which aligns with the conventions of OpenTelemetry.  We have also changed the Istio tracer from the deprecated OpenCensus tracer to OpenTelemetry. This update has resulted in an improvement to the Istio span name, which is now prefixed with the operation name. For example, a name like example.com is changed to ingress example.com. To learn more, see Switch Istio Tracing to OTLP and Align Istio Service Name.
