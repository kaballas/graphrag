Title: Istio module: Update to version 1.11.1
Description: We've updated the Istio version to 1.24.1. Read the Istio 1.24.1 release announcement and Istio 1.24.0 Change Notes. This version includes changes to compatibility version parameters. See the parameters for the previous compatibility version switched from false to true:  ENABLE_DELIMITED_STATS_TAG_REGEX: If true, Istio Pilot uses the new delimited stat tag regex to generate Envoy stats' tags.  ENABLE_DEFERRED_CLUSTER_CREATION: If enabled, Istio creates clusters only when there are requests. This saves memory and CPU cycles in cases where there are lots of inactive clusters and more than one worker thread.  This compatibility version applies the following new parameters set tofalse:  ENABLE_INBOUND_RETRY_POLICY: If true, enables retry policy for inbound routes, which automatically retries any requests that were reset before reaching the intended service.  EXCLUDE_UNSAFE_503_FROM_DEFAULT_RETRY: If true, excludes unsafe retry on 503 from the default retry policy.  PREFER_DESTINATIONRULE_TLS_FOR_EXTERNAL_SERVICES: If true, external services prefer the TLS settings from DestinationRules over the metadata TLS settings.  ENABLE_ENHANCED_DESTINATIONRULE_MERGE: If enabled, Istio merges DestinationRules based on their exportTo fields. The DestinationRules are then kept as independent rules if the exportTo fields are not equal.  PILOT_UNIFIED_SIDECAR_SCOPE: If true, unified SidecarScope creation is used. This is only intended as a temporary feature flag for backward compatibility.  ENABLE_DEFERRED_STATS_CREATION: If enabled, Istio lazily initializes a subset of the stats.  BYPASS_OVERLOAD_MANAGER_FOR_STATIC_LISTENERS: If enabled, the overload manager is not applied to static listeners.    With this release, we’ve also added zone-based podAntiAffinity rules for the istio-ingressgateway and istios Deployments. This change enhances resiliency and availability in the event of node-level or zone-level failures.
