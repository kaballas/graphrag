Title: Changes to Setup for SAP Build Process Automation Integration
Description: With an adjustment regarding environment settings on the side of SAP Build Process Automation, the integration between SAP Advanced Financial Closing and SAP Build Process Automation also needs to be adjusted.  As of now the integration will be set up using a destination created in the SAP BTP cockpit. This destination is then maintained in the system settings in SAP Advanced Financial Closing. This new approach replaces the previous out-of-the-box approach that was based on the fact that both tenants were part of the same subaccount.  This change has the benefit that for the integration to work, the subscription for the SAP Build Process Automation tenant no longer has to be part of the same SAP BTP subaccount as the one for SAP Advanced Financial Closing.  More information:How to Set Up the SAP Build Process Automation Integration for SAP Advanced Financial Closing    Area affected: Integration with SAP Build Process Automation  Action: If you've set up the integration with SAP Build Process Automation with the previous approach, you need to adjust the set up to the new approach. This includes the adjustment of the destination in the SAP BTP cockpit and a new connection setup in the Specify Communication Systems app in SAP Advanced Financial Closing.  You can find the information about the destination settings in the SAP Build Process Automation documentation. We've provided links to that documentation and information about the adjustments required in SAP Advanced Financial Closing under How to Set Up the SAP Build Process Automation Integration for SAP Advanced Financial Closing.
