Title: ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse: Planned Decommissioning Date for Deprecated Objects
Description: For formerly released but meanwhile deprecated local APIs, the system now shows their planned decommissioning date. If SAP has no concrete plans to change the state of an object to decommissioned, the date is not set, and the priorities of the corresponding ATC check results (developer extensibility) and rework tasks (key user extensibility) are lower than for objects with a planned decommissioning date. This will help you to prioritize the rework of custom objects that use deprecated APIs.  See Deprecation.
