Title: Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes - New Features
Description: A new version of the Transparent Proxy for Kubernetes (1.4.0) has been released.Transparent Proxy version 1.4.0 provides the following new features:  Multitenancy support for seamless consumption of target systems defined as TCP destinations in the different tenants and exposed locally on the level of TCP protocol. The actual communication protocol may be any TCP-based protocol, for example, ODBC/JDBC, SMTP, etc. For more information, see Multitenancy.  Simple arbitrary access to destinations. Dynamically access the target systems via a single destination custom resource, instead of creating such for every locally exposed destination.For more information, see Dynamic Lookup of Destinations.  Native integration with Istio. Easily, via single configuration, add the target systems or service endpoints exposed via Transparent Proxy to the Istio service mesh.For more information, see Configuration Guide.   Native integration with the Connectivity Proxy in multi-tenant trusted mode. You can now easily consume target systems without sending identity tokens to the Connectivity Proxy.  Automated update of service keys, in use by Transparent Proxy, upon Kubernetes secrets change.   The Transparent Proxy module in Kyma now auto-detects and loads all Destination service instance bindings within its namespace, reducing the need for manual configuration. For more information, see Transparent Proxy in the Kyma Environment.  The Transparent Proxy module in Kyma now, by default, creates a Destination service instance and binding upon enabling the module, significantly simplifying the initial setup.For more information, see Transparent Proxy in the Kyma Environment.
