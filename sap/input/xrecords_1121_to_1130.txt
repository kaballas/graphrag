Component: Kyma Runtime
Environment: Kyma
Title: Kyma CLI version 3.0.0 released
Description: We're excited to introduce a new, redesigned version of Kyma CLI for SAP, BTP Kyma runtime!  Version 3.0.0 is the first milestone in transforming Kyma CLI into a tool for application developers who use the SAP, BTP Kyma runtime as their Kubernetes-based runtime.  We introduced a completely new set of commands that are more oriented toward simplifying and automating the steps required in the application development process in Kyma. After we receive your feedback, we will fine-tune the final API of the alpha command group.  The new feature highlights are the following:      The code-to-app capability of the app push command. It automates the process of getting a running app from your source code.      Hands-on interaction with the API of Kyma and its modules (Function CR and ServiceInstance/Binding CRs as first ones).      Enabling easy automation for some common tasks developers usually do on Kubernetes clusters (for example, generating new access for service accounts).      SAP BTP Platform-specific commands allowing binding remote service instances.      For more information about the tool, check out the Kyma CLI documentation.
