Title: Pre-Production - Pricing service – Fix for variant condition field with access type A
Description: When the multivalued attribute KOMP-VARCOND field in an access is marked as hierarchical, the access field (access type = A) and the condition record with an empty variant condition key is maintained. When variant condition keys without maintained condition records were passed as input, the Pricing service used to return different results compared to the back-end pricing. This issue has been corrected.

Title: New HTTP Header for Client IP Address
Description: Beginning with this release, a new HTTP header called X-Cf-True-Client-Ip is automatically added to each HTTP request. This header contains the IP address of the client connecting to SAP BTP through the platform’s load balancer. The value of the header is a single IP address which can be utilized for IP address-based request filtering on the application side, such as per-client rate limiting and allow- or blocklisting clients by their IP addresses.  The HTTP header can also be used in conjunction with a route service, as the original client IP address is preserved in this scenario.  The header value is logged with the same key name X-Cf-True-Client-Ip by Gorouter for all incoming requests, allowing filtering and charting RTR logs by the client IP address.

Title: Default Navigation When No Permissions
Description: Previously, when a user didn’t have permission to access a menu item, the user was redirected to the home page.   Now, the user will be redirected to the first main menu item that is accessible to the user (from left to right).   If a user doesn't have permission to access any menu items, the user will be redirected to a feed page under the company home.  Customers that prefer to keep the previous behavior (redirect to the home page), can add a menu workpage with the same content as the home page and grant users permission to access it.
