Title: Delivering an Add-On Product with the Landscape Portal
Description: If you have an SAP Partner Edge Build contract, you can now publish a product as an add-on product. This offers a second delivery option for partners as an alternative to the multitenancy SaaS solution. Your product will appear in the SAP Store, where eligible customers can install it in their own SAP BTP ABAP environment system. The Landscape Portal is used for both, to publish add-on products by partners, and to install them by the customers.  For more information, see New Software Delivery Option "Add-On Product".

Title: Production - Document Pricing – Do Not Lose Condition Values During Repricing
Description: If a price recalculation with type C (Carries out a new pricing, manually entered conditions are retained) was triggered, an automatically determined condition value used to get lost in the following case: The condition appeared twice in the results, one value with control flag A (Adjust for quantity variance) and origin flag A (Automatic pricing) and another value with control flag C (Changed manually) and origin flag C (Manually entered/changed). This issue has been corrected, which can lead to unexpected pricing results if the issue was unnoticed before.

Title: Production – Size Limit for Price Determination Trace
Description: Pricing service will stop writing pricing determination traces when an estimated memory size of about 5MB was reached. That should be sufficient for most cases. When the limit is reached, a corresponding info message is added to the trace. SAP can optimize this size limit for support cases and can furthermore limit the pricing determination trace to a list of relevant condition types.
