Title: Change of Response Message in Java Web Tomcat 9
Description: When you 're running the Java ALM REST API in the deprecated Java Web Tomcat 8 runtime, the response message contains the status code and the reason phrase.  Example  Status Code: 200 OK  With the new Java Web Tomcat 9 runtime, the response message doesn't include the reason phrase anymore.  Example  Status Code: 200  Action: Because the Java ALM API starts using Java Web Tomcat 9 by the end of the year, adopt your applications to process any Java ALM response messages without the reason phrase.

Title: Connectivity Proxy for Kubernetes 2.11.0 - Changes
Description: Release of Connectivity Proxy version 2.11.0 (2.10 intentionally skipped) provides the following changes:    The "utility docker images", used by Helm for execution of pre- and post-deploy jobs can now be configured, allowing the use of private repositories.  The configured images in the helm chart can now be configured with a digest instead of tag in order to be more specific in referencing the desired image. Tag is still the default.  The Connectivity Proxy is now running on SAP Machine 17, instead of the previously used SAP Machine 11.  There is now automatic periodic checking in the Connectivity Proxy components for new CAs, used by the Connectivity service to issue Cloud Connector certificates. As a result, you no longer need to periodically perform a helm upgrade to refresh the list of trusted CAs.
