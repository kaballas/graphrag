Title: Automated Service Instance Updates for Enhanced Configuration Management
Description: We've introduced automatic updates for service instance managed by the BTP service operator, ensuring configurations stay current and aligned with referenced secrets in the parametersFrom field.   Now, any changes to Secret values used in this field of a ServiceInstance resource will automatically trigger an update request.  This enhancement optimizes configuration management by eliminating the need for manual updates to the ServiceInstance resource every time a referenced Secret value changes.   Developers and operators benefit from increased efficiency and reduced risk of configuration drift, as service instances are automatically kept in sync with the latest parameter values.  See Passing Parameters.
