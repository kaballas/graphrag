Title: Update to 'maxItems' Parameter in getChildren and Query API
Description: To improve response time and prevent open-ended parameter values that could potentially impact performance, we have reduced the default and maximum value for this parameter to 10,000.   Action: If you rely on the default 'maxItems' value for your API calls, you may need to review and adjust your implementation to ensure it aligns with the new limit. Consider specifying a value for 'maxItems' that suits your needs, especially if your application requires processing more than 10,000 items.
