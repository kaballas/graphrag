Title: Easier Identification of Free Services in SAP BTP Cockpit
Description: To help you easily identify service plans that are free of charge, we've made the following enhancements in the SAP BTP cockpit:      We've added a new Show only free tier checkbox option in the Service  Service Marketplace page. With this checkbox, you can now filter and display only the services that offer free tier plans. This option is available if your subaccount has at least one service with a free tier plan.      We've also added the Free Tier, Always Free, and Beta labels to applicable service plans in the Service  Service Marketplace and Service  Instances and Subscriptions pages.       In the Create/New Instance or Subscription dialog box in the Service  Service Marketplace and Service  Instances and Subscriptions pages, the Plan dropdown list now includes the Free Tier, Always Free, and Beta labels for applicable service plans. You can see these labels on the right-hand side of the list.
