Title: Condition Exclusion on Condition Record Level
Description: The exclusion indicator (KONP-KZNEP) that was maintained for a condition record is now considered during condition determination of the next condition types in a pricing procedure. To be able to use it, the following standard requirement formulas were changed:    Requirement formula 5 is now supported. It ensures that a condition type is only considered if the exclusion indicator was not set by a previously found condition record.      Requirement formula 6 is now supported. It ensures that a condition type is only considered if the exclusion indicator was not set to X by a previously found condition record.      Requirement formula 2 was enhanced to not only check if the pricing indicator (KOMP-PRSFD) equals X or B, but to also check that the exclusion indicator was not set by a previously found condition record.      See Condition Exclusion and Supported Standard Pricing Exits.

Title: Consider Cost Conditions as External Conditions
Description: Condition types with data source other than Condition Technique are considered as external conditions where the condition rate must be passed by the caller if it is to be considered.   Now we also consider cost condition types without an access sequence with condition category Q (Cost) and G (Internal price) as external conditions as the data for condition types without an access sequence like EK01, EK02, and VPRS cannot be found in condition records, but must be passed by the service consumer.   See API Definition.

Title: Stateless Pricing – Return Condition Scales
Description: When creating condition records in the back end, scales can be maintained. The Pricing service determines the right scale value, uses it in price calculation and returns the corresponding price, discount, or surcharge. For example, lower prices are used for higher item quantities.  With the new $select request parameter value items-conditions-scale, it will also be possible for endpoint POST /statelesspricing to get all scale values returned. With that, the calling application could, for example, tell the user: if by buy a certain higher quantity, you will get a certain better price.   See API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
