Title: Configurable Load-Balancing Algorithm for Application Routes
Description: We’ve added support for configuring the load-balancing algorithm of application routes. The route definition has been extended with a generic options map that allows you to specify which load balancing algorithm you want to use.  Supported Algorithms  Currently, the following load-balancing algorithms are supported:  round-robin: Distributes the load evenly across all available backends.  least-connection: Directs traffic to the backend with the fewest active connections at any given time.  The default algorithm is round-robin.  Configuring the Load-Balancing Algorithm of an Application Route  You have the following options for choosing the load-balancing algorithm of an application route:  Option 1: You can specify the load balancing algorithm in your application manifest using the loadbalancing property of the route options.  Option 2: You can specify the load balancing algorithm in the Cloud Foundry CLI using the commands create-route, update-route, and map-route.  For more information and detailed examples, check out the following resources:  Blog post by SAP: Support for Customizable Load-Balancing Algorithms  Cloud Foundry documentation: Configuring per-route options
