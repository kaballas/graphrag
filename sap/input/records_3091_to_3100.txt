Title: Cloud Connector 2.17.0 - Enhancements
Description: Release of Cloud Connector version 2.17.0 provides the following enhancements:    Cloud Connector 2.17 is based on a different runtime container. So far, it was based on the JavaWeb 3.x runtime on Tomcat 8.5, now it switched to JavaWeb 4.x, which is based on Tomcat 9.  The Cloud Connector can now use SAPMachine 21 as Java runtime. For more information, see Prerequisites.  Cloud Connector 2.17 supports up to 3 LDAP servers for authentication. This allows to support setups in which the user base is not completely available in a single LDAP user store, or if there are multiple user bases in a single LDAP user store.For more information, see Use LDAP for User Administration.  You can configure a separate port for the high availability (HA)- related communication between the two instances (master and shadow). This lets you use HA together with certificate-based authentication.For more information, see Install a Failover Instance for High Availability.  Additional hardware monitoring REST APIs for disk and CPU status have been provided.For more information, see Monitoring APIs.  You can now use the hardware monitor on the shadow instance as well.For more information, see Hardware Metrics.  A description for subject patterns was introduced.For more information, see Configure Subject Patterns for Principal Propagation.  Access control data now contains the creation timestamp.For more information, see Configure Access Control.  You can now add a subaccount using an authentication data file downloaded from SAP BTP. For more information, see Set up Connection Parameters and HTTPS Proxy (steps 2 + 4: file-based subaccount configuration).   The Cloud Connector UI now provides a session expiration progress bar in the top right corner of each screen, indicating how long your current session is still valid until you need to login again before proceeding.For more information, see Initial Configuration.  You can now run the new script resetCiphers from the scc folder in the Cloud Connector installation directory to reset the ciphers if UI access is blocked due to wrong cipher settings. For more information on cipher suites, see Encryption Ciphers.

Title: Document Pricing - Enable SAP CPQ to Work With Alternative Units of Measure
Description: In pricing results, the conditions rates are returned as maintained. Only condition values are returned in the target document currency based on the item's target quantity and unit of measure. To help SAP CPQ to cope with condition rates that use alternative units of measure, the item condition details of endpoint GET /api/v1/pricing/documents/{documentId} is enhanced with a new field rateNormalized, which also considers the target currency and the sales unit of measure.  This field is for use in SAP CPQ only and may change becoming incompatible at any time when requested by SAP CPQ. Do not use this field in any other integrations.  See API Definition and Development Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Document Pricing - Return Condition Scales
Description: With the last release, scales for item conditions used to be returned only by endpoint GET /api/v1/pricing/documents/{documentId}. The following endpoints have been enhanced to return the scale information as well:    POST /api/v1/pricing/documents/{documentId}/items/{itemId}/conditions      PATCH /api/v1/pricing/documents/{documentId}/items/{itemId}/conditions/{conditionId}      GET /api/v1/pricing/documents/{documentId}/items/{itemId}/conditions/{conditionId}      POST /api/v1/pricing/documents/{documentId}/itemsConditions      POST /api/v1/pricing/documents/{documentId}/itemsConditionsList      See API Definition.

Title: Extension Concept - Pass Scales to Extension Implementations
Description: Information about the scales found for a condition record can now also be requested by custom routines and can be passed as input to custom routine implementations. With that, a custom routine can also use the other scale levels as the basis for their calculations.  See Extension Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Extension Concept - Provide More Data to Requirement Implementations
Description: The pricing engine used to only pass parameters attributes and exclusioIndicator as input data to requirement implementations.  This is still the default behavior, but through a projection on fields of structure itemInput in COLLECT ATTRIBUTES' response via extendedInput>documentInput>itemInput>projection it is now also possible to request the item quantity and other conditions information for a requirement formula.  For a requirement formula, it is only possible to retrieve a subset of the conditions field for the already determined pricing conditions:    stepNumber      counter      conditionType      conditionRate      conditionUnit      scale      See API Definition and Extension Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

Title: Pricing Engine Trace - Log Inactivity Because of a Missing Routine Implementation

Title: SAP Cloud ALM Integration for Performance Monitoring
Description: The Real User Monitoring start page, which should provide an overview of all service requests, was hard to read because a very large number of individual requests was listed. This happened due to some IDs in the paths of the requests that could not be aggregated at the endpoint level. This issue has been corrected by replacing such IDs with an asterisk. With that, now you see aggregations such as /api/v1/pricing/documents/*/conditions/* or /api/v1/pricing/documents/*/items/* instead of individual requests per document id, item id, or condition id.  See Administration Guide for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.
