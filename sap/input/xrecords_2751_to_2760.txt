Title: Regenerate your credentials for Edge Integration Cell
Description: You can be prepared for an upcoming feature by knowing that we have introduced an internal mechanism within Edge Integration Cell.  Once this feature is released, the Edge Integration Cell will convert inbound certificate authentication scenarios into local authentication scenarios, minimizing the runtime dependency on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). We kindly ask for your completion of a manual activity, as detailed in the following SAP Note.  This adjustment is integral to a phased roll-out strategy, aimed at systematically reducing dependency on the Cloud Business Technology Platform and ensuring offline availability during transient connectivity disruptions.
