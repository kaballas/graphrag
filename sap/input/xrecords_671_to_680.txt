Title: Update to 'maxItems' Parameter in getChildren and Query API
Description: We are making an important update to the 'maxItems' parameter in the getChildren and Query API. The default and maximum value for this parameter is being reduced to 25,000 when no specific value is provided. This change is aimed at enhancing the response time and preventing open-ended parameter values that could potentially impact performance.  Action: If you rely on the default 'maxItems' value for your API calls, you may need to review and adjust your implementation to ensure it aligns with the new limit. Consider specifying a value for 'maxItems' that suits your needs, especially if your application requires processing more than 25,000 items.
